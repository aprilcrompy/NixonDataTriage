Transcript Data Triage methods on Watergate Trial transcripts

Abstract:
Faced with an overwhelming collection of documents, how can an analyst decide where to start? 
This use case allowed us to develop a machine learning and natural language processing methodology to enable triage of large collections of transcripts so that analysts can rapidly identify critical information. 
The source of the data for this project are a portion of the approximately 70 hours of tape subpoenaed by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF). These are fully transcribed conversations deemed evidentiary to the Watergate trial. This project supports the area of data triage by economizing and exploiting distinctive language within large datasets for analysis. 
Transcribed data has a great deal of noise, and on a dataset this large, keyword search is useless. This project explores methods to enable analysts to find relevant data by tagging/posturing the dataset, which can enable analysts to rapidly identify and retrieve information of interest within large datasets of transcribed voice collection, leading to better solutions for real-world problems.
