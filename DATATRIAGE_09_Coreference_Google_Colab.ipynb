      " John, sit down, sit down. Good morning. Well, what is the Dean summary of the day about? John caught me on the way out and asked me about why Gray was holding back on information, if that was under instructions from us.  And it, uh, it was and it wasn't. Uh, it was instructions proposed by the Attorney General, consistent with your press conference statement that no further raw data was to be turned over to the... Full committee. ...full committee. Right. And that was the extent of it.  And Gray, himself, is the one who reached the conclusion that no more information be turned over; he'd turned over enough.  Uh, so this is again Pat Gray making decisions on his own as to how to handle his hearings. He has been totally unwilling all along to take any guidance, any instruction.  We don't know what he is going to do.  He is not going to talk about it.  He won't review it, uh, and I don't think... Right. ...he does it to harm you in any way, sir. He's just quite stubborn and -- he's quite stubborn; also he isn't very smart.  You know he and I-- He's bullheaded. He's smart in his own way, but... Yeah. ...but he's got that typical, \"Well, by God, this is right and they're not going to do it.\" That's why he thinks he'll be confirmed, because he thinks he's being, he's being his own man He's being forthright, honest.  He's feels he has turned over too much and so it's a conscious decision that he is harming the Bureau by doing this and so he's not going to-- I hope to God that we can get off  though today, this is because the White House told him to do this and that other thing.  And also, I told Ehrlichman, I don't see why our little boys can't make something out of the fact that, God darn it, this is the, this is the, the only responsible decision you could possibly make.  The FBI cannot turn over raw files. Has anybody made that point?  I've tried... Sam Ervin has made that point himself. Did he? Uh, in fact, in reading the transcript of Gray's hearings, Ervin tried to hold Gray back from doing what he was doing at the time he did it.  Uh, I thought it was very unwise.  I don't think that anyone is criticizing... Well, let's say -- ...  your position on it. Let's make the point, let's make the point that the raw files cannot be turned over. Well, I think that point should be made. That, that-- We are standing for the rights of innocent individuals.  The American Civil Liberty Union is against it. We're against it.   tradition, and it will continue to be the tradition that all files are -- I'd like to turn them  let them see what is in one. How damaging-- Any further word on, on Sullivan?  Is he still-- Yeah, he's, he's going to be over to see me today, this morning, hopefully, some-time. Uh-- As soon as you get that, I'll be available to talk to you this afternoon. All right, sir. I'll be busy until about one o'clock; after that we can contact.  Anytime you're through I would like to see whatever thing he has. Well, he' 5 got something, but I'd like-to just see what it is. Uh, the reason I thought we ought to talk this morning is because in, in our conversations, uh, uh, I have, I have the impression that you don't know everything I know That's right. ...and it makes it very difficult for you to make judgments that, uh, that only you can make... That's right. ...  on some of these things and I thought that-- You've got, in other words, I've got to know why you feel that, uh, that something... Well, let me... ...that, that we shouldn't unravel something. ...let me give you my overall first. In other words, you, your judgment as to where it stands, and where we go now--- I think, I think that, uh, there's no doubt about the seriousness of the problem we're, we've got.  We have a cancer--within, close to the Presidency, that's growing.  It's growing daily.  It's compounding, it grows geometrically now because it compounds itself.  Uh, that'll be clear as I explain you know, some of the details, uh, of why it is, and it basically is because  we're being blackmailed;  uh, people are going to start perjuring themself very quickly that have not had to perjure themselves to protect other people and the like.  And that is just--and there is no assurance-- That it won't bust. That, that won't bust. True. So, let me give you the sort of basic facts' talking first about the Watergate; and then about Segretti; and then about some of the peripheral items that, uh, have come up. First of all, on, on the Watergate: How did it all start, where did it start?  It started with an instruction to me from Bob Haldeman to see if we couldn't set up a perfectly legitimate campaign intelligence operation over at the Re-election Committee. Hmm. Not being in this business, I turned to somebody who had been in this business, Jack Caulfield, who is, I don't know if you remember Jack or not.  He was your original bodyguard before PRES Yeah. ...they had... Yeah. ...candidate, candidate... Yeah. ...protection, an old New York City policeman. Right, I know, I know him. Uh, Jack had worked for John and then was transferred to my office.  I said, \"Jack, come up with a plan that, you know, is a normal infiltration, I mean, you know, buying informa- tion from secretaries and all that sort of thing.\" He did, he put together a plan.  It was kicked around, and, uh, I went to Ehrlichman with it.  I went to Mitchell with it, and the consensus was that Caulfield wasn't the man to do this.  Uh, in retrospect, that might have been a bad call, 'cause he is an incredibly cautious person and, and wouldn't have put the situation to where it is today. Yeah. All right, after rejecting that, they said, \"We still need something,\" so I was told to look around for somebody that could go over to 1701 and do this.  And that's when I came up with Gordon Liddy, who-- they needed a lawyer.  Gordon had an intelligence back- ground from his FBI service.  I was aware of the fact that he had done some extremely sensitive things for the White House while he'd been at the White House, and he had apparently done them well.  Uh, going out into Ellsberg's doctor's office... Oh, yeah. ...  and things like this.  He'd worked with leaks.  He'd, you know, tracked these things down.  Uh, and  so the report that I got from Krogh was that he was a hell of a good man and, and not only that, a good lawyer, uh, and could set up a proper operation.  So we talked to Liddy.  Liddy was interested in doing it.  Took, uh, Liddy over to meet Mitchell.  Mitchell thought highly of him because, apparently, Mitchell was partially involved in his ev--coming to the White House to work for, for Krogh.  Uh, Liddy had been at Treasury before that. Then Liddy was told to put together his plan, you know, how he would run an intelligence operation.  And this was after he was hired over there at the, uh, the Committee.  Magruder called me in January and said, \"I'd like to have you come over and see Liddy's plan.\" January of '72? January of '72.   Like, \"You come over to Mitchell's office and sit in on a meeting where Liddy is going to lay his plan out.\" I said, \"Well, I don't really know as I'm the man, but if you want me there I'll be happy to.\"  So, I came over and Liddy laid out a million dollar plan that was the most incredible thing I have ever laid my eyes on.  All in codes, and involved black bag operations, kidnapping, providing prostitutes, uh, to weaken the opposition, bugging, uh, mugging teams.  It was just an incredible thing. But, uh... And-- ...that was, that was not, uh... No. ...discussed with... No. ...other persons. No, not at all.  And--  Uh, Mitchell, Mitchell just virtually sat there puffing and laughing.  I could tell 'cause after he--after Liddy left the office  I said, \"That's the most incredible thing I've ever seen.\" He said, \" I agree.\" And so then he was told to go back to the draw-ing boards and come up with something realistic. So there was a second meeting.  Uh, they asked me to come over to that.  I came into the tail end of the meeting.  I wasn't there for the first part.  I don't know how long the meeting lasted.  Uh, at this point, they were discussing again bugging, kidnapping and the like.  And at this point I said, right in front of everybody, very clearly, I said, \"These are not the sort of things  that are ever to be discussed in the office of the Attorney General of the United States\"--where he still was--\"and I am personally incensed.\" I was trying to get Mitchell off the hook, uh, 'cause-- I know. He's a, he's a nice person, doesn't like to say no under--when people he's going to have to work with. That's right. So, I let, I let it be known.  I said, \"You all pack that stuff up and get it the hell out of here 'cause we just, you just can't talk this way in this office and you shouldn't, you shouldn't, you should re- examine your whole thinking.\" Came back-- Who else was present?  Be-, besides you-- It was Magruder, Magruder-- Magruder. Uh, Mitchell, Liddy and myself.  I came back right after the meeting and told Bob, I said, \"Bob, we've got a growing disaster on our hands if they're thinking this way.' and I said, \"The Unite House has got to stay out of this and I, frankly, am not going to be involved in it.\" He said, \"I agree John.\" And, I thought, at that point the thing was turned off.  That's the last I heard of it, when I thought it was turned off, because it was an absurd proposal. Yeah. Liddy-I did have dealings with him afterwards.  We never talked about it.  Now that would be hard to believe for some people, but, uh, we never did.  Just the fact of the matter. Well, you were talking about other things. Other things.  We had so many other things. He had some legal problems at one time. Now -- But you were his advisor, and I, I understand how you could have some, uh, what cam--what are they campaign laws--I knew that was you, you have--Haldeman told me you, that you were heading all of that up for us.  Go ahead. Now.  .  So, Liddy went back after that and it was over, over at, uh, 1701, the Committee, and I, this is where I come into having put the pieces together after the fact as to what I can put together what happened.  Liddy sat over there and tried to come up with another plan that he could sell.   They were talking, saying to him he was asking for too much money, and I don't think they were discounting the, the illegal points at this, after--you know. Jeb is not a lawyer and he didn't know whether this was the way the game was played or not, and what it was all about.  They came up with, apparently, another plan, uh, but they couldn't get it approved by anybody over there.  So, Liddy and Hunt apparently came to see Chuck Colson, and Chuck Colson picked up the telephone and called Magruder and said, \"You all either fish or cut bait. Uh, this is absurd to have these guys over there and not using them, and if you're not going to use them, I may use them.\" Things of this nature. When was this? This was apparently in February of '72. That could be.  Colson know what they were talking about? I can only assume, because of his close relation-ship with... Hunt. ...Hunt, he had a damn good idea of what they were talking about, a damn good idea. He would probably deny it, deny it today and probably get away with denying it.  But I, uh, I still-- Unless Hunt-- Unless Hunt, uh, blows on him-- But then Hunt isn't enough.  I takes two doesn't it? Probably.  Probably.  But Liddy was there also and if, if Liddy were to blow-- Then you've got a problem--I was thinking (unintelligible}the criminal liability goes. Yeah. Okay. I'll go back over that, and tell  you where I think the, the soft spots are. Colson then, then Colson then, do you think was the, uh, was the person who... I think he... ...pushed? I think he helped to get the push, get the thing off the dime.  Now something else occurred, though -- Did Colson--did he talk to anybody here? No.  I think this was an independent ... Did he talk to Haldeman? No.  I don't think so.  Now, but here's the other thing, where the next thing comes in the chain: I think that Bob was assuming that they had something that was proper over there, some intelligence gathering operation that Liddy was operating.  And through Strachan, uh, who was his tickler, uh, he started pushing them yeah. ...to get something, to get some information and they took that as a signal--Magruder took that as a signal to probably go to Mitchell and say, \"They're pushing us like crazy for this from the White House.\" And so Mitchell probably puffed on his pipe and said, \"Go ahead.\" And never really reflected on what it was all about.  So, they had some plan that obviously had, I gather, different targets they were going to go after.  They were going to infiltrate, and bug, and do all this sort of thing to a lot of these targets.  This is knowledge I have after the fact. And,  apparently, they, uh, they, they had, they had after they had initially broken in and bugged the Democratic National Committee they were getting information.  The information was coming over here to Strachan.  Some of it was given to Haldeman. Uh, there is no doubt about it.  Uh-- Did he know what it was coming from? I don't really know if he was, sir. Not necessarily. Not necessarily.  That -- not necessarily. Uh-- Strachan knew what it was from. Strachan knew what it was from.  No doubt about it, and whether Strachan--I've never wanted to press these people on these points because it... Yeah. ...it hurts them to, to give up that next inch.  So I had to piece things together. All right, so, Strachan was aware of receiving information, reporting to Bob.  At one point Bob even gave instructions to change their capabilities from Muskie to McGovern, and had passed this back through Strachan to Magruder and, and apparently to Liddy, and Liddy was starting to make arrangements to go in and bug the uh, uh, McGovern operation.  They had done prelim- ... They had never bugged Muskie, though, did they? No, they hadn't but they had a, they had, uh, they'd... . ...infiltrated it by a, a, they had... A secretary. ...a secretary and a chauffeur.  Nothing illegal about that. I suppose you're-- Now, so the information was coming over here and then, uh, I finally, after --the next point in time where I became aware of anything was on June 17th, when I got word that there had been this break-in at the Democratic National Committee and somebody from the Committee had been caught, uh, from our Committee had been caught in the DNC. And I said, \"Oh, my God, that, I can only\", you know, if, instantly putting the pieces together-- You knew what it was. I knew what it was.  So I called Liddy, uh, on that Monday morning, and I said, \"Gordon\" - I said, \"first, I want to know if anybody- in the White House was involved in this.\" And he said, \"No.\" And they weren't.  I said,  \"Well, I want to know how in God's name-this happened.\" And he said, \"Well, I was pushed without mercy by Magruder to get in there, get more information--that the information, it was not satisfactory.  Magruder said, 'The White House is not happy with what we're getting.\"' The White House? The White House.  Yeah, Uh-- Who do you think was pushing him? Well, I think it was probably Strachan thinking that Bob wanted things, and because because I have seen that happen on other occasions where things have been said to be Of very prime importance when they really weren't. Why  I wonder?  I'm just try-ing to think as to why then.  We'd just finished the Moscow trip.  I mean, we were-- That's right. The Democrats had just nominated Mc G-, Mc Govern.  I mean, for Christ's sakes, I mean, what the hell were we--I mean, I can see doing it earlier but I mean, now let me say, I can see the pressure, but I don't see why all the pressure would have been one then. I don't know, other than the fact that, uh, they might have been looking for information about The convention. ...the conventions. Well, that's right. Because, I understand, also after the fact, that there was a plan to bug Larry O'Brien's suite down in Florida. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, Liddy told me, that uh, you know, this is what had happened and, and this is why it had happened. Liddy told you he was planning--where'd you learn there was such a plan--from whom? Beg your pardon. Where did you learn of the plans to bug Larry O'Brien's suite? From Magruder, after the, long after the fact. Oh, Magruder, he knows. Yeah.  Magruder is totally knowledgeable on the whole thing. Yeah. All right, now, we've gone through the trial.  We've--I don't know if Mitchell has perjured himself in the Grand Jury or not. I've never-- Who? Mitchell.  I don't know how much knowledge he actually had.  I know that Magruder has perjured himself in the Grand Jury.  I know that Porter has perjured himself, uh, in the Grand Jury. Porter . He's one of Magruder's deputies. Yeah. Uh, that they set up this scenario which they ran by me.  They said, \"How about this?\" I said, \"Well, I don't knot.  I, you know, if, if this is that you're going to hang on, fine.\" Uh, that they-- What did they say before the Grand Jury? They said, they said, as they said before the trial and the Grand Jury, that, that, uh, Liddy had come over as, as a counsel and we knell he had these capacities to, you knoll, to do legitimate intelligence.  We had no idea what he was doing.  He was given an authorization of 250,000 dollars.. Right. ...to collect information, because our surrogates were out on the road.  They had no protection.  We had information that there were going to be demonstrations against them, that, uh, uh, we had to have a plan to get information as to what liabilities they were going to be confronted with... Right. ...and Liddy was charged with doing this. We had no knowledge that he was going to bug the ARC.  Uh-- Well, the point is, that's untrue. That's right. Magruder did know that-- - Magruder was specifically instructed him to go back in the DNC. He did? Yes. You know that?  Yeah, I see.  Okay. Uh, - I honestly believe that noose over here knew that.  I know, uh, as God is my maker, I had no knowledge that they were going to do this. Bob didn't either . Oh, but, you know, Unintelligible) Bob, Bob-- he wouldn't-- Bob I don't believe specifically knew they were going in there. I don't think so. I don't think he did.  I think he knew there was a capacity to do this, but he wouldn't, wasn't giving it specific direction. Strachan, did he know? I think Strachan did know. They were going back into the DNC?  Hunt never entered DNC. All right, so--uh, those people are in trouble as a result of the Grand Jury and the trial.  Mitchell, of course, was never called during the trial.  Now -- Mitchell has given a sworn statement? Yes, sir. To the Bureau? To the Grand Jury -- Did he go before the Grand Jury? He had, we had a, an arrangement whereby he went down to, with several of the -- because it was, you know, the heat of this thing and the implications on the election' we made an arrangement where they could quietly go into the Department of Justice and have one of The Assistant U.S.  Attorneys come over and take their testimony and then read it before the Grand Jury.  Uh-- That was . Although I--that's right.  Mitchell la5 actually called before the Grand Jury.  Tile Grand Jury would not settle for less.  The Jurors wanted him. And he went. And he went. Good. Uh, I don't know what he said.  Uh, so I've never seen a transcript of the Grand Jury. Now  what, what has happened post- June 17?  Well, it was, I was under pretty clear instructions  not to really investigate this, that this was something that just could have been disastrous on the election if it had--all hell had broken loose, and I worked on a theory of containment... Sure. ...to try to hold it right where it was. Right There's no doubt, I, I, uh, that, uh, I was totally aware what the Bureau was doing at all times.  I was totally aware of what the Grand Jury was doing. You mean-- I knew what witnesses were going to be called.  I knew what they were going to be asked, and I had to.  There just-- Why did Petersen play the, play the game so straight with us? Because Petersen is a soldier.  He played-- he kept me informed.  He told me when we had problems, where we had problems, and the like Uh, he believes in, in, in you.  He believes in this Administration.  This Administration has made him.  Uh, I don't thinly he's done anything improper, but he did make sure the investigation was narrowed dozen to the very, very... Plight. ...fine... Right. ...criminal things, which was a break for us.  There's no doubt about it. He honestly feels that he did an adequate job? He, uh, they ran that investigation out to the fullest extent they could follow a lead  and that was it. But the point is, where I suppose he could be criticized for not-doing an adequate job is why didn't he call Haldeman?  Thy didn't he get a statement from Colson?  Or they did get Colson? That's right.  But see, the thing is, is based on their FBI interviews, there was no reason to follow up.  There were no leads there.  Colson said, \"I have no knowledge of this\" to the FBI.  Uh, Strachan said, \"I have no knowledge of--\" you know.  They didn't ask Strachan any Watergate questions. They asked him about Segretti.  Uh, they said, \"What's your connection with Liddy?\" and he just said, \"Well, I, you know I just, met him over there,\" and they never really pressed him.  They didn't you know, they-- look, Strachan appeared, uh, as a result of some coaching, he could be the dumbest paper pusher in the bowels of the, the White House.  All right, now, post-June 17th, these guys immediately--it is very, very  interesting --Liddy, for example, the Friday  before--uh, on I guess it was the, uh on the 15th, uh, 16th, uh, of, uh, June--had been in Henry Petersen's office with another member of my staff on campaign compliance  problems, uh, joking.  After the incident, he went, he ran, uh, Kleindienst doom at Burning Tree Country Club and told  him that \"You've got to get my men out of jail,\" which was kind of a-- Kleindienst said, \"Now, you get the hell out of here, kid, uh, uh, whatever you've got to say, just say to somebody else.  Don't bother me,\" and-- but this has never come up. Yeah. Uh, Liddy said, said that, you know -- they all got counsel instantly and said that, you know' \"she'll, we'll ride this thing out.\" All right, then they started waking demands; We've got to have attorneys' fees.  Uh, we don’t have any money ourselves, and if-you are asking us to take this through the election.\" All right, so arrangements were made through Mitchell, uh, initiating it, in discussions that--I was present-that these guys had to be taken care of.  Their attorneys' fees had to be done.  Kalmbach alas brought in.  Uh, Kalmbach raised some cash.  Uh, they were, uh, you know-- They put that under the cover of a Cuban Committee or . Yeah, they, they had a Cuban Committee and they had--some of it was given to Hunt's lawyer, who in turn passed it out.  This, you know, when Hunt’s wife was flying to Chicago with ten thousand, she was actually, I understand after the fact now, was going to pass that money to, uh, one of the Cubans, to meet him in Chicago and pass it to somebody there. Why didn't she  maybe--well, whether it's maybe too late to-do anything about it, but I would certainly keep that,  that cover for whatever it's worth. I'll... Keep the Committee. DEAN Af-, after, well, that, that; that's the most troublesome post-thing, uh, because  Bob is involved in that; John is involved in that; I'm involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that.  And that's an obstruction of justice. In other words the fact that uh, that you're you're, you're taking care Of the witnesses. That's right, uh-- How was Bob involved? Well, th-, they ran out of money over there. Bob had three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a safe over here that was really set aside for polling purposes.  ills and there was no other source of money, so they came over here and said, \"You all've got to give us some money.\" Right. I had to go to Bob and say, \"Bob, you know, you've got to have some--they need some money over there.\" He said \"What for?\" And so I had to tell him what it was for 'cause he wasn't about to just send money over there willy-nilly.  And, uh, Jolly was involved in those discussions, and we decided, you know, that, you know, that there was no price too high to pay to let this thing blow up in front of the election. I think you - should handle that one pretty fast. Oh, I think-- That issue, I mean. I think we can. So that the three-fifty went back ov-, over here That's alright.  I think we can too. Who else is? But, now, here, here's what's happening right now. Yeah. What sort of brings matters to the--this is  this-is going to be continual black- mail operation by Hunt and Liddy and the Cubans.  No doubt about it.  And McCord... Yeah . who is, who is another one involved.  McCord has asked for nothing.  Uh, McCord did ask to meet with somebody, and it was Jack Caulfield, who is his old friend, who'd gotten him hired over the-ret And, when, when, when Caulfield had him hired, he was a perfectly legitimate security man.  And he wanted to know, well, you know,  he wanted to talk about commutation, and things like that.  And as you know Colson has talked to, indirectly to Hunt about commutation.  .  All these things are bad, in, in, in that they are problems, they are promises, they are commitments.  They are the very sort of thing that the Senate is going to be looking most for.  I don't think they can find them, frankly. Pretty hard. Pretty hard.  Damn hard.  It's all cash. Uh-- Lowell, I mean, pretty hard as far as the witnesses are concerned. That's right.  Now, The blackmail is continuing.  Hunt called one of the lawyers from the Re-election Committee on last Friday to meet with him on--over the weekend.  The guy came in to me, to see me to get a message directly from Hunt to me, for the first time. Is Hunt out on bail? Pardon? Is Hunt on bail? Hunt is on bail.  Correct.  Uh, Hunt now is demanding another seventy-to thousand dollars for his own personal expenses; another fifty thousand dollars to pay his attorneys' fees; a hundred and twenty some thousand dollars.  Wants it, wanted it by the close of business yesterday.  'Cause he says, \"I'm going to be sentenced on Friday, and I've got to be able to get my financial affairs in order.\" I told this fellow O'Brien, \"You came--all right, you came to the wrong man, fellow.  I'm not involved in the money.  Uh, I don't know a thing about it, can't help you.\" Said, \"You better scramble around elsewhere.\" Now, O'Brien is, O'Brien.  is, is a ball player.  He's been, he carried tremendous water for us.  Uh-- He isn't Hunt's lawyer, is he? No, he is, he is our-lawyer at the Re- election Committee. I see, good. So he's safe.  There's no problem there. But it raises the whole question of Hunt now has made a direct threat against Ehrlichman, as a result of this.  This is his blackmail. He says, \"I will bring John Ehrlichman down to his knees and put him in jail.  Uh, I have done enough seamy things for he and Krogh, uh, that they'll never survive it.\" What's that, on Ellsberg?  - Ellsberg, and apparently some other things. I don't know the full extent of it.  Uh-- I don't know about anything else. I don't know either, and I  hate to learn some of these things.  So that's, that 's that situation.  Now, we're at the soft points.  How many people know about this? Hell, uh, well, let me go one step further in this, this whole thing.  The Cubans that were used in the Watergate were also the same Cubans that Hunt and Liddy used for this California Ellsberg thing, for the break-in out there. Yeah. So they're, they're aware of that.  How high their knowledge is, is something else.  Hunt and Liddy, of course, are totally aware of, of, of it, and the fact that, uh, it was rift out of the White House. I don't know what the hell we did that for. I don't either. What in the name of God did that-- Mr. President, there have been a couple of things around here that I have gotten wind of.  Uh, there was at one time a desire to do a second-story job on the Brookings Institute where they had the Pentagon Papers.  Now I flew to California because I was told that John had instructed it and he said, \"I really hadn't.  It's- a misimpression, that for Christ's sake, turn it off.\" And I did.  I came back and turned it off.  Because, you know the, when you, you know, if the risk is minimal and the, and the gain is fantastic, it's something else.  But with a low risk and uh, no gain, uh, hey, it's just, uh, it's not worth it. Well--who knows about this all now?  All right, you've got  the Cubans' lawyer's' a man by the name of Rothblatt, who is a no-good, publicity- seeking, son-of-a-bitch, to be very frank about it.  He has had to be turned down and tuned off.  He was canned by his own people cause they didn't trust him.  They were trying to run a different route than he wanted to run.  He didn't want them to plead guilty.  He wants to represent them before the Senate.  So, F. Lee Bailey, who was the partner of one of the, one of the men representing McCord; uh, got in and, and cooled Rothblatt down.  So, F. Lee B-, Bailey's got knowledge.  Uh, Hunt's lawyer, a man by the name of Bittman, who's an excellent criminal lawyer from the Democratic era of Bobby Kennedy, he's got knowledge.  Uh-- Do you think, do you think, that he's got some How much? Well, everybody-not only, all the, all the direct knowledge that Hunt and Liddy have, as well as all the hearsay they have. I . Uh, you've got the trio lawyers over at the Re-election Committee who did an investigation to find out the facts. Slowly, they got the whole picture. They're, uh, they're solid, but they're-- But they know. But they know.  Uh, you've got, then, an awful lot of--all the principals involved know.  Uh, Hunt--some people's wives know.\n",
      " John , sit down , sit down . Good morning . Well , what is the Dean summary of the day about ? John caught me on the way out and asked me about why Gray was holding back on information , if that was under instructions from us .  And it , uh , it was and it was n't . Uh , it was instructions proposed by the Attorney General , consistent with Mr. press conference statement that no further raw data was to be turned over to the ... Full committee . ... full committee . Right . And that was the extent of it .  And Gray , Gray , is the one who reached the conclusion that no more information be turned over ; Gray 'd turned over enough .  Uh , so this is again Pat Gray making decisions on Gray own as to how to handle Gray hearings . Gray has been totally unwilling all along to take any guidance , any instruction .  We do n't know what Gray is going to do .  Gray is not going to talk about it .  Gray wo n't review information , uh , and I do n't think ... Right . ... Gray does it to harm you in any way , sir . Gray 's just quite stubborn and -- Gray 's quite stubborn ; also Gray is n't very smart .  You know Gray and I-- Gray 's bullheaded . Gray 's smart in Gray own way , but ... Yeah . ... but Gray 's got that typical , \" Well , by God , this is right and they 're not going to do it . \" That 's why Gray thinks Gray 'll be confirmed , because Gray thinks Gray 's being , Gray 's being Gray own man Gray 's being forthright , honest .  Gray 's feels Gray has turned over too much and so it 's a conscious decision that Gray is harming the Bureau by doing this and so Gray 's not going to-- I hope to God that we can get off  though today , this is because the White House told Gray to do this and that other thing .  And also , I told Ehrlichman , I do n't see why our little boys ca n't make something out of the fact that , God darn it , this is the , this is the , the only responsible decision you could possibly make .  The FBI can not turn over raw files . Has anybody made that point ?  I 've tried ... Sam Ervin has made that point Sam . Did Sam ? Uh , in fact , in reading the transcript of Gray 's hearings , Ervin tried to hold Gray back from doing what Gray was doing at the time Gray did it .  Uh , I thought it was very unwise .  I do n't think that anyone is criticizing ... Well , let 's say -- ...  John position on it . Let 's make the point , let 's make the point that the raw files can not be turned over . Well , I think that point should be made . That , that-- We are standing for the rights of innocent individuals .  The American Civil Liberty Union is against it . We 're against it .  tradition , and it will continue to be the tradition that all files are -- I 'd like to turn files  let them see what is in one . How damaging-- Any further word on , on Sullivan ?  Is Sullivan still-- Yeah , Sullivan 's , Sullivan 's going to be over to see me today , this morning , hopefully , some - time . Uh-- As soon as you get that , I 'll be available to talk to you this afternoon . All right , sir . I 'll be busy until about one o'clock ; after that we can contact .  Anytime you 're through I would like to see whatever thing Sullivan has . Well , Sullivan ' 5 got something , but I 'd like - to just see what something is . Uh , the reason I thought we ought to talk this morning is because in , in our conversations , uh , uh , I have , I have the impression that you do n't know everything I know That 's right . ... and it makes it very difficult for you to make judgments that , uh , that only you can make ... That 's right . ...  on some of these things and I thought that-- You 've got , in other words , I 've got to know why you feel that , uh , that something ... Well , let me ... ... that , that we should n't unravel something . ... let me give you John overall first . In other words , you , John judgment as to where it stands , and where we go now--- I think , I think that , uh , there 's no doubt about the seriousness of the problem we 're , we 've got .  We have a cancer -- within , close to the Presidency , that 's growing .  It 's growing daily .  It 's compounding , it grows geometrically now because it compounds itself .  Uh , that 'll be clear as I explain you know , some of the details , uh , of why it is , and it basically is because  we 're being blackmailed ;  uh , people are going to start perjuring themself very quickly that have not had to perjure people to protect other people and the like .  And that is just -- and there is no assurance-- That it wo n't bust . That , that wo n't bust . True . So , let me give you the sort of basic facts ' talking first about the Watergate ; and then about Segretti ; and then about some of the peripheral items that , uh , have come up . First of all , on , on the Watergate : How did it all start , where did it start ?  It started with an instruction to me from Bob Haldeman to see if we could n't set up a perfectly legitimate campaign intelligence operation over at the Re - election Committee . Hmm . Not being in this business , I turned to somebody who had been in this business , Jack Caulfield , who is , I do n't know if you remember Jack or not .  Jack was John original bodyguard before PRES Yeah . ... they had ... Yeah . ... candidate , candidate ... Yeah . ... protection , an old New York City policeman . Right , I know , I know Jack . Uh , Jack had worked for John and then was transferred to John office .  I said , \" Jack , come up with a plan that , you know , is a normal infiltration , I mean , you know , buying informa- tion from secretaries and all that sort of thing . \" Jack did , Jack put together a plan .  Liddy was kicked around , and , uh , I went to Ehrlichman with Liddy .  I went to Mitchell with Liddy , and the consensus was that Caulfield was n't the man to do this .  Uh , in retrospect , that might have been a bad call , 'cause Jack is an incredibly cautious person and , and would n't have put the situation to where situation is today . Yeah . All right , after rejecting that , they said , \" We still need something , \" so I was told to look around for somebody that could go over to 1701 and do this .  And that 's when I came up with Gordon Liddy , who-- they needed a lawyer .  Gordon had an intelligence back- ground from Jack FBI service .  I was aware of the fact that Jack had done some extremely sensitive things for the White House while Jack 'd been at the White House , and Jack had apparently done things well .  Uh , going out into Ellsberg 's doctor 's office ... Oh , yeah . ...  and things like this .  Jack 'd worked with leaks .  Jack 'd , you know , tracked these things down .  Uh , and  so the report that I got from Krogh was that Jack was a hell of a good man and , and not only that , a good lawyer , uh , and could set up a proper operation .  So we talked to Liddy .  Liddy was interested in doing it .  Took , uh , Liddy over to meet Mitchell .  Mitchell thought highly of Jack because , apparently , Mitchell was partially involved in Jack ev -- coming to the White House to work for , for Krogh .  Uh , Liddy had been at Treasury before that . Then Liddy was told to put together Jack plan , you know , how Jack would run an intelligence operation .  And this was after Jack was hired over there at the , uh , the Committee .  Magruder called me in January and said , \" I 'd like to have you come over and see Liddy 's plan . \" January of ' 72 ? January of ' 72 .  Like , \" You come over to Mitchell 's office and sit in on a meeting where Liddy is going to lay Liddy plan out . \" I said , \" Well , I do n't really know as I 'm the man , but if you want me there I 'll be happy to . \"  So , I came over and Liddy laid out a million dollar plan that was the most incredible thing I have ever laid John eyes on .  All in codes , and involved black bag operations , kidnapping , providing prostitutes , uh , to weaken the opposition , bugging , uh , mugging teams .  It was just an incredible thing . But , uh ... And-- ... that was , that was not , uh ... No . ... discussed with ... No . ... other persons . No , not at all .  And--  Uh , Mitchell , Mitchell just virtually sat there puffing and laughing .  I could tell 'cause after Mitchell -- after Liddy left the office  I said , \" That 's the most incredible thing I 've ever seen . \" Mitchell said , \" I agree . \" And so then Mitchell was told to go back to the draw - ing boards and come up with something realistic . So there was a second meeting .  Uh , people asked me to come over to that .  I came into the tail end of the meeting .  I was n't there for the first part .  I do n't know how long the meeting lasted .  Uh , at this point , people were discussing again bugging , kidnapping and the like .  And at this point I said , right in front of everybody , very clearly , I said , \" These are not the sort of things  that are ever to be discussed in the office of the Attorney General of the United States\"--where Mitchell still was--\"and I am personally incensed . \" I was trying to get Mitchell off the hook , uh , ' cause-- I know . Mitchell 's a , Mitchell 's a nice person , does n't like to say no under -- when people Mitchell 's going to have to work with . That 's right . So , I let , I let it be known .  I said , \" You all pack that stuff up and get stuff the hell out of here 'cause we just , you just ca n't talk this way in this office and you should n't , you should n't , you should re- examine people whole thinking . \" Came back-- Who else was present ?  Be- , besides you-- It was Magruder , Magruder-- Magruder . Uh , Mitchell , Liddy and John .  I came back right after the meeting and told Bob , I said , \" Bob , we 've got a growing disaster on our hands if people 're thinking this way . ' and I said , \" The Unite House has got to stay out of this and I , frankly , am not going to be involved in thing . \" Bob said , \" I agree John . \" And , I thought , at that point the thing was turned off .  That 's the last I heard of thing , when I thought thing was turned off , because Liddy was an absurd proposal . Yeah . Liddy - I did have dealings with Jack afterwards .  We never talked about it .  Now that would be hard to believe for some people , but , uh , we never did .  Just the fact of the matter . Well , you were talking about other things . Other things .  We had so many other things . Jack had some legal problems at one time . Now -- But you were Jack advisor , and I , I understand how you could have some , uh , what cam -- what are they campaign laws -- I knew that was you , you have -- Haldeman told me you , that you were heading all of that up for us .  Go ahead . Now .  .  So , Liddy went back after that and it was over , over at , uh , 1701 , the Committee , and I , this is where I come into having put the pieces together after the fact as to what I can put together what happened .  Liddy sat over there and tried to come up with another plan that Jack could sell .  They were talking , saying to Jack Jack was asking for too much money , and I do n't think they were discounting the , the illegal points at this , after -- you know . Jeb is not a lawyer and Jack did n't know whether this was the way the game was played or not , and what it was all about .  They came up with , apparently , another plan , uh , but they could n't get plan approved by anybody over there .  So , Liddy and Hunt apparently came to see Chuck Colson , and Chuck Colson picked up the telephone and called Magruder and said , \" You all either fish or cut bait . Uh , this is absurd to have these guys over there and not using Liddy , and if you 're not going to use Liddy , I may use Liddy . \" Things of this nature . When was this ? This was apparently in February of ' 72 . That could be .  Colson know what people were talking about ? I can only assume , because of Chuck close relation - ship with ... Hunt . ... Hunt , Chuck had a damn good idea of what people were talking about , a damn good idea . Chuck would probably deny it , deny it today and probably get away with denying it .  But I , uh , I still-- Unless Hunt-- Unless Hunt , uh , blows on him-- But then Hunt is n't enough .  I takes two does n't it ? Probably .  Probably .  But Liddy was there also and if , if Liddy were to blow-- Then you 've got a problem -- I was thinking ( unintelligible}the criminal liability goes . Yeah . Okay . I 'll go back over that , and tell  you where I think the , the soft spots are . Colson then , then Colson then , do you think was the , uh , was the person who ... I think Jack ... ... pushed ? I think Jack helped to get the push , get the thing off the dime .  Now something else occurred , though -- Did Colson -- did Jack talk to anybody here ? No .  I think this was an independent ... Did Jack talk to Haldeman ? No .  I do n't think so .  Now , but here 's the other thing , where the next thing comes in the chain : I think that Bob was assuming that they had something that was proper over there , some intelligence gathering operation that Liddy was operating .  And through Strachan , uh , who was Bob tickler , uh , Bob started pushing them yeah . ... to get something , to get some information and they took that as a signal -- Magruder took that as a signal to probably go to Mitchell and say , \" They 're pushing us like crazy for this from the White House . \" And so Mitchell probably puffed on Mitchell pipe and said , \" Go ahead . \" And never really reflected on what it was all about .  So , they had some plan that obviously had , I gather , different targets they were going to go after .  They were going to infiltrate , and bug , and do all this sort of thing to a lot of these targets .  This is knowledge I have after the fact . And ,  apparently , they , uh , they , they had , they had after they had initially broken in and bugged the Democratic National Committee they were getting information .  The information was coming over here to Strachan .  Some of information was given to Haldeman . Uh , there is no doubt about it .  Uh-- Did Bob know what information was coming from ? I do n't really know if Bob was , sir . Not necessarily . Not necessarily .  That -- not necessarily . Uh-- Strachan knew what information was from . Strachan knew what information was from .  No doubt about it , and whether Strachan -- I've never wanted to press these people on these points because it ... Yeah . ... it hurts people to , to give up that next inch .  So I had to piece things together . All right , so , Strachan was aware of receiving information , reporting to Bob .  At one point Bob even gave instructions to change their capabilities from Muskie to McGovern , and had passed this back through Strachan to Magruder and , and apparently to Liddy , and Liddy was starting to make arrangements to go in and bug the uh , uh , McGovern operation .  They had done prelim- ... They had never bugged Muskie , though , did they ? No , they had n't but they had a , they had , uh , they 'd ... . ... infiltrated Muskie by a , a , they had ... A secretary . ... a secretary and a chauffeur .  Nothing illegal about that . I suppose you're-- Now , so the information was coming over here and then , uh , I finally , after --the next point in time where I became aware of anything was on June 17th , when I got word that there had been this break - in at the Democratic National Committee and somebody from the Committee had been caught , uh , from Committee Committee had been caught in the DNC . And I said , \" Oh , my God , that , I can only \" , you know , if , instantly putting the pieces together-- You knew what it was . I knew what it was .  So I called Liddy , uh , on that Monday morning , and I said , \" Gordon \" - I said , \" first , I want to know if anybody- in the White House was involved in this . \" And Jack said , \" No . \" And they were n't .  I said ,  \" Well , I want to know how in God 's name - this happened . \" And Jack said , \" Well , I was pushed without mercy by Magruder to get in there , get more information -- that the information , information was not satisfactory .  Magruder said , ' The White House is not happy with what we 're getting . \" ' The White House ? The White House .  Yeah , Uh-- Who do you think was pushing Bob ? Well , I think it was probably Strachan thinking that Bob wanted things , and because because I have seen that happen on other occasions where things have been said to be Of very prime importance when things really were n't . Why  I wonder ?  I 'm just try - ing to think as to why then .  We 'd just finished the Moscow trip .  I mean , we were-- That 's right . The Democrats had just nominated Mc G- , Mc Govern .  I mean , for Christ 's sakes , I mean , what the hell were we -- I mean , I can see doing it earlier but I mean , now let me say , I can see the pressure , but I do n't see why all the pressure would have been one then . I do n't know , other than the fact that , uh , people might have been looking for information about The convention . ... the conventions . Well , that 's right . Because , I understand , also after the fact , that there was a plan to bug Larry O'Brien 's suite down in Florida . Yeah . Uh , so , uh , Liddy told me , that uh , you know , this is what had happened and , and this is why it had happened . Liddy told you Jack was planning -- where'd you learn there was such a plan -- from whom ? Beg John pardon . Where did you learn of the plans to bug Larry O'Brien 's suite ? From Magruder , after the , long after the fact . Oh , Magruder , Magruder knows . Yeah .  Magruder is totally knowledgeable on the whole thing . Yeah . All right , now , we 've gone through the trial .  We've -- I do n't know if Mitchell has perjured Mitchell in the Grand Jury or not . I 've never-- Who ? Mitchell .  I do n't know how much knowledge Mitchell actually had .  I know that Magruder has perjured Magruder in the Grand Jury .  I know that Porter has perjured Porter , uh , in the Grand Jury . Porter . Porter 's one of Magruder 's deputies . Yeah . Uh , that they set up this scenario which they ran by me .  They said , \" How about this ? \" I said , \" Well , I do n't knot .  I , you know , if , if this is that you 're going to hang on , fine . \" Uh , that they-- What did they say before the Grand Jury ? They said , they said , as they said before the trial and the Grand Jury , that , that , uh , Liddy had come over as , as a counsel and we knell Jack had these capacities to , you knoll , to do legitimate intelligence .  We had no idea what Jack was doing .  Jack was given an authorization of 250,000 dollars .. Right . ... to collect information , because surrogates surrogates were out on the road .  surrogates had no protection .  We had information that there were going to be demonstrations against surrogates , that , uh , uh , we had to have a plan to get information as to what liabilities surrogates were going to be confronted with ... Right . ... and Liddy was charged with doing this . We had no knowledge that Jack was going to bug the ARC .  Uh-- Well , the point is , that 's untrue . That 's right . Magruder did know that-- - Magruder was specifically instructed Magruder to go back in the DNC . Magruder did ? Yes . You know that ?  Yeah , I see .  Okay . Uh , - I honestly believe that noose over here knew that .  I know , uh , as God is John maker , I had no knowledge that people were going to do this . Bob did n't either . Oh , but , you know , Unintelligible ) Bob , Bob-- Bob wouldn't-- Bob I do n't believe specifically knew people were going in there . I do n't think so . I do n't think Bob did .  I think Bob knew there was a capacity to do this , but Bob would n't , was n't giving it specific direction . Strachan , did Strachan know ? I think Strachan did know . people were going back into the DNC ?  Hunt never entered DNC . All right , so -- uh , those people are in trouble as a result of the Grand Jury and the trial .  Mitchell , of course , was never called during the trial .  Now -- Mitchell has given a sworn statement ? Yes , sir . To the Bureau ? To the Grand Jury -- Did Mitchell go before the Grand Jury ? Mitchell had , we had a , an arrangement whereby Mitchell went down to , with several of the -- because it was , you know , the heat of this thing and the implications on the election ' we made an arrangement where election could quietly go into the Department of Justice and have one of The Assistant U.S.  Attorneys come over and take statement testimony and then read statement before the Grand Jury .  Uh-- That was . Although I -- that 's right .  Mitchell la5 actually called before the Grand Jury .  Tile Grand Jury would not settle for less .  The Jurors wanted Mitchell . And Mitchell went . And Mitchell went . Good . Uh , I do n't know what Mitchell said .  Uh , so I 've never seen a transcript of the Grand Jury . Now  what , what has happened post- June 17 ?  Well , it was , I was under pretty clear instructions  not to really investigate this , that this was something that just could have been disastrous on the election if it had -- all hell had broken loose , and I worked on a theory of containment ... Sure . ... to try to hold Committee right where Committee was . Right There 's no doubt , I , I , uh , that , uh , I was totally aware what the Bureau was doing at all times .  I was totally aware of what the Grand Jury was doing . You mean-- I knew what witnesses were going to be called .  I knew what witnesses were going to be asked , and I had to .  There just-- Why did Petersen play the , play the game so straight with us ? Because Petersen is a soldier .  Petersen played-- Petersen kept me informed .  Petersen told me when we had problems , where we had problems , and the like Uh , Petersen believes in , in , in you .  Petersen believes in this Administration .  This Administration has made Petersen .  Uh , I do n't thinly Petersen 's done anything improper , but Petersen did make sure the investigation was narrowed dozen to the very , very ... Plight . ... fine ... Right . ... criminal things , which was a break for us .  There 's no doubt about it . Petersen honestly feels that Petersen did an adequate job ? Petersen , uh , Bureau ran that investigation out to the fullest extent Bureau could follow a lead  and that was it . But the point is , where I suppose Petersen could be criticized for not - doing an adequate job is why did n't Petersen call Haldeman ?  Thy did n't Petersen get a statement from Colson ?  Or Bureau did get Colson ? That 's right .  But see , the thing is , is based on Bureau FBI interviews , there was no reason to follow up .  There were no leads there .  Colson said , \" I have no knowledge of this \" to the FBI .  Uh , Strachan said , \" I have no knowledge of-- \" you know .  Bureau did n't ask Strachan any Watergate questions . Bureau asked Strachan about Segretti .  Uh , Bureau said , \" What 's Strachan connection with Liddy ? \" and Strachan just said , \" Well , I , you know I just , met Jack over there , \" and Bureau never really pressed Strachan .  Bureau did n't you know , they-- look , Strachan appeared , uh , as a result of some coaching , Strachan could be the dumbest paper pusher in the bowels of the , the White House .  All right , now , post - June 17th , these guys immediately -- it is very , very  interesting --Liddy , for example , the Friday  before -- uh , on I guess it was the , uh on the 15th , uh , 16th , uh , of , uh , June -- had been in Henry Petersen 's office with another member of John staff on campaign compliance  problems , uh , joking .  After the incident , Jack went , Jack ran , uh , Kleindienst doom at Burning Tree Country Club and told  Kleindienst that \" You 've got to get Jack men out of jail , \" which was kind of a-- Kleindienst said , \" Now , you get the hell out of here , kid , uh , uh , whatever you 've got to say , just say to somebody else .  Do n't bother me , \" and-- but this has never come up . Yeah . Uh , Liddy said , said that , you know -- people all got counsel instantly and said that , you know ' \" Jack 'll , people 'll ride this thing out . \" All right , then people started waking demands ; people 've got to have attorneys ' fees .  Uh , people do n’t have any money people , and if - you are asking us to take this through the election . \" All right , so arrangements were made through Mitchell , uh , initiating it , in discussions that -- I was present - that these guys had to be taken care of .  people attorneys ' fees had to be done .  Kalmbach alas brought in .  Uh , Kalmbach raised some cash .  Uh , Kalmbach were , uh , you know-- Kalmbach put that under the cover of a Cuban Committee or . Yeah , Kalmbach , Kalmbach had a Cuban Committee and Kalmbach had -- some of cash was given to Hunt 's lawyer , who in turn passed it out .  This , you know , when Hunt ’s wife was flying to Chicago with ten thousand , Hunt was actually , I understand after the fact now , was going to pass that money to , uh , one of the Cubans , to meet Cubans in Chicago and pass money to somebody there . Why did n't Hunt  maybe -- well , whether it 's maybe too late to - do anything about it , but I would certainly keep that ,  that cover for whatever it 's worth . I 'll ... Keep the Committee . DEAN Af- , after , well , that , that ; that 's the most troublesome post - thing , uh , because  Bob is involved in that ; John is involved in that ; I 'm involved in that ; Mitchell is involved in that .  And that 's an obstruction of justice . In other words the fact that uh , that you 're you 're , you 're taking care Of the witnesses . That 's right , uh-- How was Bob involved ? Well , th- , people ran out of money over there . Bob had three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a safe over here that was really set aside for polling purposes .  ills and there was no other source of money , so people came over here and said , \" You all've got to give us some money . \" Right . I had to go to Bob and say , \" Bob , you know , you 've got to have some -- people need some money over there . \" Bob said \" What for ? \" And so I had to tell Bob what money was for 'cause Bob was n't about to just send money over there willy - nilly .  And , uh , Jolly was involved in those discussions , and we decided , you know , that , you know , that there was no price too high to pay to let this thing blow up in front of the election . I think you - should handle that one pretty fast . Oh , I think-- That issue , I mean . I think John can . So that the three - fifty went back ov- , over here That 's alright .  I think John can too . Who else is ? But , now , here , here 's what 's happening right now . Yeah . What sort of brings matters to the -- this is  this - is going to be continual black- mail operation by Hunt and Liddy and the Cubans .  No doubt about it .  And McCord ... Yeah . who is , who is another one involved .  McCord has asked for nothing .  Uh , McCord did ask to meet with somebody , and somebody was Jack Caulfield , who is McCord old friend , who 'd gotten McCord hired over the - ret And , when , when , when Caulfield had McCord hired , McCord was a perfectly legitimate security man .  And Gray wanted to know , well , you know ,  Gray wanted to talk about commutation , and things like that .  And as you know Colson has talked to , indirectly to Hunt about commutation .  .  All these things are bad , in , in , in that things are problems , things are promises , things are commitments .  things are the very sort of thing that the Senate is going to be looking most for .  I do n't think Jury can find things , frankly . Pretty hard . Pretty hard .  Damn hard .  It 's all cash . Uh-- Lowell , I mean , pretty hard as far as the witnesses are concerned . That 's right .  Now , The blackmail is continuing .  Hunt called one of the lawyers from the Re - election Committee on last Friday to meet with Committee on -- over the weekend .  The guy came in to me , to see me to get a message directly from Hunt to me , for the first time . Is Hunt out on bail ? Pardon ? Is Hunt on bail ? Hunt is on bail .  Correct .  Uh , Hunt now is demanding another seventy - to thousand dollars for Hunt own personal expenses ; another fifty thousand dollars to pay Hunt attorneys ' fees ; a hundred and twenty some thousand dollars .  Wants dollars , wanted dollars by the close of business yesterday .  'Cause Hunt says , \" I 'm going to be sentenced on Friday , and I 've got to be able to get Hunt financial affairs in order . \" I told this fellow O'Brien , \" You came -- all right , you came to the wrong man , fellow .  I 'm not involved in the money .  Uh , I do n't know a thing about money , ca n't help you . \" Said , \" You better scramble around elsewhere . \" Now , O'Brien is , O'Brien .  is , is a ball player .  O'Brien 's been , O'Brien carried tremendous water for us .  Uh-- O'Brien is n't Hunt 's lawyer , is O'Brien ? No , O'Brien is , O'Brien is our - lawyer at the Re- election Committee . I see , good . So Hunt 's safe .  There 's no problem there . But it raises the whole question of Hunt now has made a direct threat against Ehrlichman , as a result of this .  This is Hunt blackmail . Hunt says , \" I will bring John Ehrlichman down to John knees and put John in jail .  Uh , I have done enough seamy things for Krogh and Krogh , uh , that Krogh 'll never survive it . \" What 's that , on Ellsberg ?  - Ellsberg , and apparently some other things . I do n't know the full extent of it .  Uh-- I do n't know about anything else . I do n't know either , and I  hate to learn some of these things .  So that 's , that 's that situation .  Now , we 're at the soft points .  How many people know about this ? Hell , uh , well , let me go one step further in this , this whole thing .  The Cubans that were used in the Watergate were also the same Cubans that Hunt and Liddy used for this California Ellsberg thing , for the break - in out there . Yeah . So Liddy 're , Liddy 're aware of that .  How high Liddy knowledge is , is something else .  Hunt and Liddy , of course , are totally aware of , of , of it , and the fact that , uh , it was rift out of the White House . I do n't know what the hell Liddy did that for . I do n't either . What in the name of God did that-- Mr. President , there have been a couple of things around here that I have gotten wind of .  Uh , there was at one time a desire to do a second - story job on the Brookings Institute where they had the Pentagon Papers .  Now I flew to California because I was told that John had instructed it and John said , \" I really had n't .  It's- a misimpression , that for Christ 's sake , turn thing off . \" And I did .  I came back and turned thing off .  Because , you know the , when you , you know , if the risk is minimal and the , and the gain is fantastic , it 's something else .  But with a low risk and uh , no gain , uh , hey , it 's just , uh , it 's not worth it . Well -- who knows about this all now ?  All right , you 've got  the Cubans ' lawyer 's ' a man by the name of Rothblatt , who is a no - good , publicity- seeking , son - of - a - bitch , to be very frank about it .  Rothblatt has had to be turned down and tuned off .  Rothblatt was canned by people own people cause people did n't trust Rothblatt .  people were trying to run a different route than Rothblatt wanted to run .  Rothblatt did n't want people to plead guilty .  Rothblatt wants to represent people before the Senate .  So , F. Lee Bailey , who was the partner of one of the , one of the men representing McCord ; uh , got in and , and cooled Rothblatt down .  So , F. Lee B- , Bailey 's got knowledge .  Uh , Hunt 's lawyer , a man by the name of Bittman , who 's an excellent criminal lawyer from the Democratic era of Bobby Kennedy , Hunt 's got knowledge .  Uh-- Do you think , do you think , that Hunt 's got some How much ? Well , everybody - not only , all the , all the direct knowledge that Hunt and Liddy have , as well as all the hearsay Liddy have . I . Uh , you 've got the trio lawyers over at the Re - election Committee who did an investigation to find out the facts . Slowly , facts got the whole picture . facts 're , uh , facts 're solid , but they're-- But facts know . But facts know .  Uh , you 've got , then , an awful lot of -- all the principals involved know .  Uh , Hunt -- some people 's wives know .\n"
