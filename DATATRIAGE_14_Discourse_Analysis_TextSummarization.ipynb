Apparently, apparently, he is quite distressed with Colson. He thinks Colson has abandoned him. It was placed in safe deposit boxes here. That's right, uh, it's not, there's nothing criminal about it. It was private polls. ...other, other odd jobs like that. There's a surplus-- ...politically embarrassing, but not as, not criminal. There were surveys, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, There is no need to account for that. Uh, now-- The source of the money, there's no illegality in having a surplus, is there, in cash afterwards? The other vulnerabilities: We've got a, uh, runaway Grand Jury up in the Southern District. They're after Mitchell and Stans on some sort of bribe or influence peddling... On Vesco. Apparent' y, Ehrlichman had some meetings with Vesco, also. Uh, we couldn't presume immunity there? I think that would be dynamite to defend, uh... Yeah. He didn't authorize anything like ultimately evolved. Because he has to, he has to disprove a negative. shy isn't  civil rights statute be used to pick up any of these clowns that were demonstrating against us, then? And, uh-- We were, those were, uh, that was interfering with the campaign. That's right, uh-- We cannot have-- That's what really troubles me. He was, he helped push the thing. Yeah You know, they just, I think if it starts crumbling, fingers will be pointing, and-- That's right. What are your feelings toward the options? I think there are, I think there are soft spots. Everyone's pulling in. They're scared and that's just, you know, that's bad. Uh, another thing is, you know, my facility now to deal with the multitude of people I have been dealing with has been hampered because of Gray blowing me up into the front page. You mean--hat would you go to jail on ? It would seem to me that would be worthwhile. And politically it'd be impossible for, you know, you to do it. You mean, that, that is provided Hunt breaks. And, while we can, we've got, I think we've got it buried, there is no telling when it's going to pop up. That's another thing I missed, missed in the cycle, in the circle. But what I am coming to you today with is I don't have a plan of how to solve it right now, but I think it's at the Juncture that we should begin to think in terms of, of how to cut the losses; how to minimize the further growth of this thing; rather than further compound it by, you know, ultimately paying these guys forever. I think that would be devastating. Now, on the other hand, we realize that we have these weaknesses-- that, uh,  we've got this weakness in terms of- blackmail. The, the individuals who are charged with shooting John Stennis are on the street. They've got these fellows all stuck with hundred thousand dollar bonds. He's a, he's is Just a, a peculiar animal, and uh, he set, set the bond for one of the others -- I don't have all the facts, but he set the bond for one of the others -- somewhere around fifty or sixty thousand dollars. When could you have this meeting Judith these fellows, as I think that time is of the essence, in my opinion.\n",

No, seriously, National security. We had to get information for national security grounds. Because they were...we had to do it, we had to do it, on a confidential basis. And the same with the drug field with Krogh. That's why... That's the way Bud rests easy, because he's, he's, he's convinced that he was doing it...he said there was treason about the country, and it could have threatened the way the war was handled.

Yeah. uh, that, uh, hell, he'd be lucky if he were out a year from now, after the Ervin hearings were, uh, you know, over. He said, \"How in the Lord's name could you be commuted that quickly?\" See, that, that really, that's very believeable cause Colson Do you think Colson could have told him Colson is an, is an that's, that's your fatal flaw, really, in Chuck, is he is an operator in expediency, and he will pay at the time and where he is whatever he has to, to accomplish what he's there to do. No, I...uh, Kleindienst has now got control of the parole board, and he said that now we can, we can pull paroles off now where we couldn't before. Well, so much depends upon hoist Sirica sentences. He can do all kinds of permanent sentences. Of course, can't you appeal on a, on an unjust sentence, as well as on an unjust conviction? There is no appellate review of sentences. I think that's our greatest jeopardy. It wasn't all returned in a lump sum. And the balance was all returned to LaRue. LaRue tool it, and then what? And what this was supposed to be was loans. This was... Yeah immediate cash needs that was going to be re..., replenished. They have been that's why these fellows have been on or off the reservation all the way along.

Okay, but you, but you, you do have rules of evidence. They, they're going to stonewall it, uh, as it now stands. That's why, that's the leverage in his threat. That's why, that's why...

Well but, but, he argues that, that wasn't necessarily  Yeah. I, I don't know-  Now, he did know there was an intelligence apparatus. Well, particularly when it's not to sip champagne. And, and if you follow his containment line, the odds...  Yeah. Hugh Sloan knows it. It was used for, for various payments and that's where-  As far as this is concerned, this is, is, I'd, I'd say constructively that Stans is clean. HALDE  Well, what it was was that money  I know. For candidate support and research. That had been collected in years prior to 1971. It's a convicted felon against his word. They're, they're fanatics and they don't seem to really be too concerned about their pulling the load and their needs are, are fairly minimal, and Dean confirms again that Liddy, Liddy is enjoying, Liddy's in jail, he, he didn't  Yeah. ...stay out, he, he said, \"I want to start serving my term,\" and he's at, at, uh, Danbury and thoroughly enjoying it.

Well, that was, that was a very, that was a, that was a shot across the bow. ...And, uh, from the way he talks I'm, I'm thoroughly convinced of that. Dean is thoroughly convinced that he knew. HALDE  But, the other side of that coin is, if you're- unless you decide to throw Magruder to the wolves, you need to keep Magruder on as even a keel as you can. He's exactly the opposite. You know, I would have never thought that Navy aide would have a nervous breakdown. Because Magruder is loaded with ego, personal pride, political ambition, uh,... I've got to-  What they-the enterprise out of there, which is the key thing-that, that Hunt, you see, Hunt-, what Hunt says is that he'll uncover some of the sleazy work he did for Ehrlichman.

Pardon me, er, er, Magruder intended to make a clean breast of it and that, that was first party information and very reliable, and that that would tend to begin to unravel this thing from the center in both directions. That I was freezing him out of the operation? He has a very, very bad tremor. Well, I've never noticed...  Shakes. Do you think you should ask him that or do you not want to go digging on that? The point is that I want it to seem you want him to be, without guiding him or leading him, you can at least maybe get that out.

They say, \"No eggs, no milk, no 14 .\" The, the inspectors say you have to have tile walls. In other words, you don't milk an extra cow just because you like to. He's not milking gross. He's not milking additional heads of cow just becuase he has a love for the dairy industry cow. But, uh -- Really, what we'll really get down to here is psycho is, is psychology. Your, your judgment on the psychology is that he is likely not to, to yield production. They consolidated now just recently.

We will goto a non-union contractor because the union contractor has priced himself out of the market,Now, so therefore, it has a to the psychological. The West Coast? The other thing that's going on in the, uh, non-Grade-A statement of this dairy industry is that we have, uh, standards that are being imposed on these dairy farmers at the farm where they're not going to be able to produce milk in the barn yard, under a shade tree. That's demonstrated, uh, Mr. President, uh, I want to repeat. A hundred thousand dollars? A hundred thousand won't do it. And that this is the philosophy of living in our rural communities. Basically, Mr. President, I'm from Iowa, and, as you drive along the road, you see farmstead after farmstead empty, falling into disrepair, in the, these changing times. And the exodus from the farm sphere has been to the urban areas. Right, I refer to spiritually in the broadest sense of the -- And I  mean by that, the cities are all corrupt.

Hog prices are down what, uh, fif--seventeen dollars-- dollars from twenty-nine. These dairymen are organized; they're adamant; they're -5- militant. This particular group, AMPI, which is the American Milk Producers Institute or some thing, uh, represents about forty thousand people The one that parallels them on the East, uh, Mid Con, or something Mid-American. And, uh, they're doing some things that I think are a little strong-armed tactics, perhaps, in, uh, the organizing, uh. There's no point in denying the farmer what's the practice for labor. And, uh, and, uh, they'll pull the liberals on this one, uh, because they're, they'll say they're going to embarrass the President. Uh, the liberals might attract the consumers in any other situation. I mean, that's the way they'll cut the liberals off. And they say that it'll cost you Missouri, Wisconsin, South Dakota for sure. Veto will probably cost you Ohio, Kentucky and Iowa. uh, about whether they really could influence production. Not because they're milk producers, but because they're farmers. And under the circumstances, I think the best thing to do is to just, uh, relax and enjoy it. Yeah, I would-- Well, I would say the price is stable.

Changing the par--when compared The dairy business, on the other hand, requires an enormous net invest--, investment. Mr. President, two litters per year and the average now is running better than seven pigs per litter, isn't it? Mr. President, there has been some studies run on this and the cost is approximately, it approaches two thousand dollars per cow. seventy or eighty. Well, we won't prosecute the farmers. Meat, meat imports. But Mr. Houthaker called me yester--He's convening a meeting now, and, uh, he thinks we ought to force the price of beef down. They've all written articles; they're just bleeding about what the President did. And, uh, they're, and uh, so I called Ed and I said, \"Now, I want to see you bleed in your publications. Profit rising. It, uh--as much as-- Everybody have one of these dairy departmental committees studying something you can favor. Well, cattle prices are down. And just remember when you talk about food prices, now, and, and bleed for the consumer, that today, food prices in the United States are cheaper than they've ever been in the history of this nation. Sixteen percent. You, you'd, uh, you know what to commit your, your friends and our friends and so on. eighty-five percent of parity. We're not suddenly going for 505, and I would guess 498.

He's a--apart from being a splendid  and, uh, smart--and he, he gave me a ra-- rationale which he's writing up for john Dean--for invoking Executive Privilege for all but certain defined areas where individual wrongdoing might be involved. His analysis of it is that if you can't have a confidential--the President cannot have immediate advisors and a confidential relationship unless he is assured that that confidentiality can be preserved, like a law clerk, with a, with a judge or Congressional aide, and, uh--  Mmm hrm. We said that, that it was a privileged relationship, uh, separation of powers,we argued. However, uh, we would voluntarily make it available for a restricted area negotiated in advance. I, I think it should be extremely limited though. They, they had that security unit set up in the basement of the EOB which Bud Krogh ran. And they were, that was perfectly legitimate. Uh, investigating the authenticity of...    ...of the Dita Beard letter was was a perfectly legitimate thing. Uh, the thing you can't do is you can't get part way pregnant. Uh, uh, he was a...  off--  ...Cabinet officer and he had--did have... And convenient memory. But the point is  or not, you, you, mean that this, this concern about Hunt cracking which you expressed, uh, incorrect? He would limit the losses. Gee  Ya know that's the--of course that's the--  Burglars without weapons. In terms of the...    ...consequences publicly it's just preposterous--   because that, uh, Hiss was a traitor -- it was a cover-up. A cover-up is, is the main ingredient. Not the merits of the thing,  I I pled the merits all the way up. Is that where you think  trail leads? See they got this and they're dripping it up little by little. They were scared stiff. Not only that they, he, he wrote off all the, all the loans which which was a--a direct avoidance of the statute and, uh we-  Not an evasion. Not an evasion. Not an evasion. After the election they'd write off the loan. So it becomes a contribution absolute. Everyone I've talked to has said, \"Congratulate the President on the prisoners.”  And that just--the impact of that is, is, uh, the equivalent of a thousand Watergates.

      " Uh, he's very square corners. You know, kind of the retired Navy Captain. Uh he, he's vulnerable according, according to John's analysis. One is whether or not he handled  Watergate adequately and John says, \"I think he'll acquit himself very nicely there.\" There, John says, uh, the established bureaucracy of the Bureau will be feeding all kinds of garbage...  Yeah. Uh, you would say, \"Pat, I had an arrangement with J.  Edgar Hoover that up until now I have not had with you and I missed it. He, he was contingent, and we had this thing hanging up, and he's tracked reasonably well. February 14, 1973 5 from 5:34 - 6:00 p.m.  What if he, uh...  Well, it just isn't necessary.

No, no that directive was not given out. February 16, 1973 10 from 9:08 - 9:39 a.m. ...in 1968 and he told Mitchell the same thing. ...and we wanta knock it down.

I knew the reason, I knew the allegations existed and I think, I think one thing Mr. President, I would like to say to you, because I believe I must say it to you, those, those people over there are like little old ladies in tennis shoes and they've got some of the most vicious vendettas going on and their gossip mill is...

You see, the thing is that there's a lack of discipline over there at the present time. And the reason is that, it wasn't because they loved him, but they feared him. ...The reason, Pat that the relationship of the Director, to the Director and President is like the relationship of the President and the Commander, uh, uh, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. February 16, 1973 16 from 9:08 - 9:39 a.m. I think Mr. President -- The leaks are, leaks- are occurring. February 16, 1973 17 from 9:08 - 9:39 a.m. That's right, from some place, but as to discipline, I have done things with regard to discipline that Mr. Hoover didn't dare to do. I gotta have a relationship here where you go out and do something and deny on a stack of Bibles. I can't hire some asshole from the outside. February 16, 1973 19 from 9:08 - 9:39 a.m. That's the kind of thing where you don’t want to have that done by Felt or whoever is down the line. He was overly suspicious, actually.

Because I'm sure...- Vesco-- I'm sure that Stans would never do a thing like that.

Stans just responded to your brother and said, uh, \"I don't  really care--whatever they want to do,'' and that's what he relayed back and it's, uh--He wasn't, he, he didn't even understand why he was there.

March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 3  That's kind of a curious position he's put himself in yesterday. …without hesitation, hesitation, it did not happen. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 4  That's exactly right. Yeah but -what's he trying to -is he trying to pander to these people too much, is that it? March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 5    Well, anyway. …the FBI from time to time on organized crime has been of assistance but it's not been overt…  Sure. …it's been more covert assistance…  Yeah, exactly. to preserve the principle. RESTRICTED-“D” that was a major uh a major confrontation and the, Truman said, hell no. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 6   against a party now I think that's a hell of a good column for somebody to write or something. Got newsmen out of bed, et cetera. I mean they talk about harassing newsmen. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 7  Yeah, well as a matter of fact, that was only, our of course, as you know, our  what, what was happening there - we were trying to get some very, from the FBI on a colder basis, a very - just some background on Schorr. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 8  in terms of what Johnson did, uh you know and who, how the reverse of the coin thing and how that came in but how Johnson used it and so forth and so on. I hope Kleindienst is appalled, it's just unbelievable. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 9  Bull shit. That'll shake that Bureau right to its roots. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 10  Just sort of, just bring him in and say alright Deke we're all taking one, how about you? March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 11  Let people worry a little, you know, that's the thing you know, Kendall's a blustery kind of a guy, I'd say now, it would just, as if we want you to know as a friend, don't want to hurt anybody but that, uh, tell him that the boys in the wood work are talkin'- the little boys down in the woodwork. And there is a hot newspaper reporter, Kevin Phillips is all over this and trying to get it out. But that he did do some tapping of telephones, maybe Agnew's phone. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 12  That's our problem, isn't it? Well, just say that there are people in the woodwork...  Well, that's --  …calling, you know, he won't know whether it's normal Bureau channels or not. He just played the wrong horse. What's the matter with Tolson? Of course, Tolson's  brother is with the White House Historical Society. Check also when his birthday is, that'd be another thing. I'm sure Hoover told Tolson every Goddamned thing he did 'cause Hoover, Hoover blabbed a lot. Some of them are, are from the Mafia, no doubt they're backed by the Mafia. That's what I   Interesting observation. He said, well, you know, he talks too much but the good poker player he's got the cards. I think Gray'll be all right once we get him through these hearings, ah, we  Yah, he is loyal. He'll try but we're going to shake that Goddamned FBI up just like Schlesinger's shaking up the other. It would have to be that way, otherwise, you're jeopardizing one of the institutions of government that, uh - but I don't see that, I don't see Gray, uh… March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 18  No. March 1, 1973 9:18 – 9:45 a.m. 19  Yup. Well when he said, you know, he said jump, everybody jumped. They might not have liked jumping but they sure did jump.

      "  Well, I was wondering what your latest developments were. Where do you live? Where do you live, are you staying? Ah, I would say that as a result of your press conference that the forward momentum that was going and building stopped, and, and, that it, it fluctuated and again we're, in this breeding space.\" It couldn't I uh, try to find something nasty to say but they, they realized that it was a cooperative effort, uh  what we have to do is be in a good posture, uh, come the opening gun on Ervin's hearings. Here's what we've concluded and we welcome you to review it. That what, ah, distressed me quite a bit. Right, Mitchell just sat there on his pipe and puffed and said nothing. You could say that they were gonna engage in intelligence operations, you said the main thing is that, ah, ah, it must be totally legal and that the laws and ethics and-so forth and so on. Ah, while we would collect normal demonstration intelligence, we needed specific intelligence as to were there concerted efforts by opposing political people to demonstrate, cause disruption,  get these peaceniks whipped up into a frenzy, and a like. And that's, uh, uh, then Haldeman said tinder no circumstances, or mention them whatever they are, it all had to be done privately because the Bureau may not be involved in a partisan contest. And I think that you know, innocent people here, who have committed no crime... 30th of April? I changed it to the 29th. His point now is you don't really need it 'cause—that--we don't need to send it up til the 10th... ...is if the trade relates to the current international crisis...  Yeah. ...and you're assuring him that it does...  Yeah, right. Loud noises. Would you try Congressman Wilbur Mills of Arkansas? Well, he, ah, I don't know whether we've had to buy a pig in a poke or not . And so, George, you know -Then he says he will then set aside, he will announce the 19th that because the President has indicated that the trade is so urgent. Always the thirtieth, yeah. He sent the legislation up on the 10th. April 30th is what we were shooting on. George has to be prepared for his tax proposal on the 30th. So what we really will need is to, ah, well, we all have a - we won't have a bi-partisan meeting on the 10th.  . So  it's kind of a hiatus right there, and I don't know as, uh, Baker will go aboard unless Kleindienst assures him they have something to produce and I don't know if Kleindienst has anything to produce. That's correct that I have no foreknowledge... They worried about, as I understand it, the San Diego demonstrations. Espionage, sabotage, shit. Not espionage, not sabotage. In connection with Hunt? In connection with Hunt and Liddy both. ...there are all the materials relating to Hunt. That's where -- that's where -- where, ah, Ervin's rules of relevancy--I'd like to know--Now what the hell has this got to do with it? That silly woman out of there. Hunt went out for disguises and doctors and what. He had some red wig on, and, and funny glasses and went out and interviewed her, ah, but that's nothing, you know, there's nothing there, he didn't do anything illegal there. I don't think he should fart around about it a bit.\n",

I said that's ridiculous, it's childish and doesn't do us any good. Because if Mitchell was the authority. The President's campaign manager. It's a misdemeanor. It's a misdemeanor committed without our specific knowledge so I don't see how, how we`re liable. ...mailing We had, we had the same thing in'60, uh'62 in California Democrats for Nixon  The Dem, no the Committee to preserve the, the Committee to Preserve the Democratic Party in California. The thing that crazy woman got us into Naomi Baxter.

It wasn't me and I don't think it has to be Dwight, but Dwight, Dwight I think may have to recant some of these  or explain them. Oh, it's what, I mean, uh, maybe my reasoning is fallacious, but our real concern is Mitchell. The other people were employees of Liddy's. That's what he, he's frantically trying to keep -not frantically) persistently trying to keep... Liddy'll appeal it... strings in Who are appealing it? Liddy's appealing that... Liddy's appealing but Liddy's not appealing on uh, merit, on the merits. He's appealing on the, on the errors. Liddy's going for errors. appeal game is purely on errors.

There's -- as I say, Herb's problems are There’s a surplus-- politically embarrassing, but not as--not criminal. There were surveys, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The other vulnerabilities:  We've got a, uh, runaway Grand Jury up in the Southern District. They're after Mitchell and Stans on some sort of bribe or influence peddling On Vesco. -47 Uh, we couldn't presume immunity there? I think that would be dynamite to defend, uh Yeah. He didn't authorize anything like ultimately involved. Again, this is one that, uh, it is potential that, Dwight Cha--, Chapin could have a felony charge against him in this',because he’s-- Felony? Felony, because he has to, he has to disprove a negative. Why isn't that a civil rights statute used to pick up any of these clowns that were demonstrating against us, then? And, uh-- We were, those were, uh, that was interfering with the campaign. Well here, what really, what really bothers me is that this, this growing situation. As I say, it is growing because of the, the continued need to provide support for the Right. He -52 was, he helped push the thing. you know, they just, I think if it starts crumbling, fingers will be pointing. and then he'll have to disprove it, and it’ll just get nasty and it'll be a Yeah. What are your feelings about the options? I think there are t--, I think there are soft spots. Everyone’s pulling in. They're scared and that's just, You know, that’s bad. Uh, another thing is, you know, my facility now to deal with the multitude of people I have been dealing with has been hampered because of Gray's blowing me up into the front page. The obstruct--, the obstruction of justice. -60 It would seem to me that would be worthwhile. And politically, it'd be impossible for, you know, you to do it. And, while we can, we've got I think we've got it buried, there is no telling when it's going to pop up. That s another thing I missed, missed in the cycle--in the circle. Uh So Ehrlichman on the, uh-- But what I am coming to you today with is: I don't have a plan of how to solve it right now, but I think it's at the juncture that we should begin to think in terms of, of how to cut the losses; how to minimize the further growth of this thing, rather than further compound it by, you know, ultimately paying these guys forever. That, that's worth buying time on, right. You know, they haven't announced yet, but it, uh-- Isn't that what the potential is? The, the individuals who are charged with shooting John Stennis are on the street. They've got these fellows all stuck with hundred thousand dollar bonds. He's a, he is just a, a peculiar animal, and, uh, he set, set the bond for one of the others--I don't have all -70 the facts, but he set the bond for one of the others—around fifty or sixty thousand dollars.\n",

He said, \"How in the Lord's name could you be commuted that quickly?”  He said, \"Well, that's my commitment from Colson.\" See that, that really, that's very believable 'cause Colson, Do you think Colson could have told him -- Colson is an, is an—that’s, that's your fatal flaw, really, in Chuck, is he is an operator in expediency, and he will pay at the time and where he is Yeah. HALD9 whatever he has toto accomplish what he's there to do. No, I--Uh, Kleindienst has now got control of the parole board, and he said that now we can, we can pull paroles off now where we couldn't before. Well, so much depends upon how Sirica sentences. He can sor--, sentence, sentence in a way that, uh, makes parole even impossible. He can do all kinds of permanent sentences. Of course, can't you appeal on a, on an unjust sentence as well as on an unjust conviction? There is no appellate review of sentences. I think that's our greatest jeopardy. It wasn't all returned in a lump sum. And the balance was all returned to LaRue. And what this was supposed to be was loans. immediate cash needs that was going to be re--, replenished. They have been--That's why these fellows have been on or -97 off the reservation all the way along. Well, that was just to get us through November seventh, though. to November seventh. Except they could have sold--these fellows could have sold out to the Democrats for a fantastic amount. I don't think, I don't think necessarily that's the cleanest way. Uh, well-- And there'd be some rules of evidence, aren't there? There are rules of evidence. -101 O.K., but you, but you, you do have rules of evidence. They, they're going to stonewall it, uh, as it now stands. That's why, that's the leverage in his threat. That's why, that's why, God, if he can lay this that's why your, for your immediate thing you've got no choice with Hunt but the hundred and twenty or whatever it is. And I, I said, \"Have you talked to, to Pappas?”  He was at home, and Martha picked up the phone so it was all in code. And I said, \"Is the Greek bearing gifts?”  He said, \"Well, I want to call you tomorrow on that.\" As I say, we're a bunch of amateurs in that business. Because they were afraid to, because of this that's what I mean; that's the trouble: We are so God damned square that  we'd get caught. you, you've got to have full appreciation of there is really no control over that.\n",

And, uh, I think we disagree as to whether or not that's a viable option or not. I, I think you could get out a fairly credible document that would stand up, and that will have the effect of trimming the scope, and would have the effect of maybe becoming the battleground on a reduced scope, which I think is important. That's the other, I mean, that's, that's the option, period. That's the other thing, whether we're going to, say, to contain the thing. Uh, his, his indirect contacts with John don't contemplate that at all. However, can he, by talking, uh, get pardoned? I have pleaded guilty to an offense. They are going to have rather intense civil discovery.

Well, we have to realize that, uh, the attrition is going to be rather considerable. But now's the time to pull it up, all out   Plus, they're not going to have the key witnesses. If it's something that, uh, is palatable, they'll go on with their job. The hue and cry would be that \"This is, this is a super cover-up. Now they realize they've got guilty people, so they, they've immunized them so that they can't be prosecuted.\" The perception is the important thing. And, and people get indicted, and people, uh, get tarnished. After we've stonewalled it? After we've stonewalled it, and after the President's been accused of covering up that way. And that under the circumstances, that, uh, grinds the man. Uh, but, uh--    I think that the President's in a stronger position later, and the Presidency is in a stronger position later if he can be shown to have justifiably relied on you at this point in time.

Say,  \"here's a fine man who's been unfortunately splattered by this thing. Really, Dean, that Dean cooked the whole thing up at Haldeman`s instruction. I, Dean doesn`t seem to be sure whether it was implicit or explicit. That, incidentally, is, a potential source of fascinating problems in that it involved Mike Acree, who`s now the Customs Commissioner or something, Joe Woods, uh, a few other people. But, in the process of that they are mixing apples and oranges for their own protection. Well, now, how do you square that with the allocation of money to it? And, uh, that  what he has told some of the lawyers, may well be a shot across the bow to jar that meeting loose. But he does see very definitely and holds also to the theory of mixing of apples and oranges. That is by Frank Dale, who is the, the Chairman of the Committee. But they are involved in the post-discovery, post-June 17th. What's made him shaky is that he's seen McCord bouncing out there and probably walking out scot free. Scot free, - a hero.

We had the concern about the integrity of other documents and we had concern about the relationship of this particular leak to other security leaks that we had across the government--Rand and, and so forth--and so we moved very vigorously on the whole cast of characters in the Pentagon Papers thing. Well, that, that's an inference that arises. That indicate to me that he was programming Hunt at that point in time. Now, I never had the slightest information that Colson . But we are now at a point where fact and fiction are becoming badly confused. People who are involved, or were then accused to be. So, I'm creating a super panel which will have the cooperation of all investigative agencies. And the panel is empowered to act to remove, anybody that it sees fit because of involvement, to level fines and to impose criminal sanctions. And the people appearing before them will voluntarily submit to that. Uh, I don't know. No, then, you sort of condemned him by… Negative inference. We're all condemned by negative inference right now. I, I appreciate that, but that's-- You're not condemned by a court. Well, I, that isn't, that isn't a sine qua non on this thing. Former Governor, or something like that. But, uh, if you would want Earl Warren, if he'll do it, but he's down in Florida. It's knowledge than we possess right now. Mitchell despises Rogers. It ruins him in a way he becomes a, he becomes a folk hero to the media. He becomes a hero with the media. But, but…  …Mike Wallace will get him and he will go on \"Sixty Minutes,\" and he will come… Right. With other witnesses, not through his own mouth.

I think that, I think that the stroke Bob has with him is that the, in the confrontation to say, \"Jeb, you know that just plain isn't so,\" and, uh, uh, just stare him down on some of this stuff and it's a golden opportunity to do that and I mean, uh, and I think you will only have this one opportunity to do it.

      "  Maybe we, uh-- Prominent Americans. The former, both executive and legisla-- and judicial type, and then have two senior judges plus Ervin and Baker. I don't think you want to anyway. All right, whose talks to, uh, who talks to, uh, should, uh, should John Ehrlichman and you talk to Bill Rogers, or is that a waste of time? He said,  “0h, no, they are not after John Mitchell.\" McCord's talked to everybody he can, including Mary McGrory, uh, uh. Weicker is Gray's sponsor. Terrible people around him, evil men. And the President wants the information. I don't think you can just kick the Attorney General out like that, you know. Well, once you establish it, that you are following that route, if they were smart, they would just start naming everybody just so you'd, you'd… except that. What, what I'm getting at here and, maybe that isn't the way to do it, I don't know, is to insulate you, number one… Right. It's a, it's a blue ribbon, four star grand jury. Uh, one other thing that, uh, delays your coming down, is, is, uh. What's, what's the earliest convenient time for you. I've got Boggs at three. He's going to check with Weicker and then I left it with him that he would either report through me if it were appropriate, or if not, to you direct, so that, uh, you'll hear one way or the other. He's going to call Weicker? I don't know Weicker  but, uh, but mostly he  here--  What the hell makes Weicker kick? I don't know of any specific… SEVERAL  …down here at all, uh--I've heard that he's just establishing his independence at this point against the upcoming Committee hearings. That's the most important thing is to keep the momentum of the presidency going... That's right. Well uncomfortable, not difficult. It takes a little preparation. Three o'clock, and then I think-- Should I also see Kleindiesnt? And Mitchell finds that absolutely incompetence and says it is Kleindienst's responsibility  He's supposed to be sending us . Now, unless--and they're--all told that the president and if you have any information to the contrary you want to know. Yeah, it doesn't come in the Mc Cord letter. And, and he is flowing with the stream, you see, he's, he's saying the things they want him to say. I don't mean if he says, if I, I mean-- Oh, if he sticks to his old story—I see, I see. Who grants immunity? I have a real woodshed  Mitchell God damned disappointed. you know, he'll just jump up and down and shout . We're not going to allow it. And the President wants to know-- That he, that that's what he, that, that's the purpose. We're not going to wait til a Grand Jury drags them up there. I, I know setting up these commissions are so difficult so-- Well, we'll see, see what Weicker says. I don't think you can hold that against the judge. You know, I, I, I do in a way, but you know He's the proprietor of a court room and he… Right. The thing that I got, that… Well, that's what I mean. The thing that I get over, over and over again from just ordinary folks… Alright. Ziegler is not sufficiently credible on this. I mean, I'm not going to-- You grant executive privilege; you say, I am waiving, executive privilege? You instructed us to be as forthcoming as we can. I think you've got to say that, Bob. On other matters-- And that takes you up to the June 17th--What do you do after June l7th? Well, since you want to waive privilege so that we can say no, rather than invoking it, uh— You think you can say that? I think you've got to say it because basically, uh, basically their situation… Well, Colson would be very disturbed by, that and he must have a reason why he would. Well, why don't we get, why don't you get his arguments so that I can hear it clearly and I will know. “The President is trying to fight this battle on his battleground. He's as clean as a hound's tooth. He's as clean as anybody you can find. The idea that a Commission might go through the '74 Election and so forth. I think the God damn thing is going to come out anyway and I think you better cut the losses now and just be a little, just better get it over much, frankly, sharper. Well, come out or not come out, you're not quite committed to this route. You are not necessarily forcing it all to come out. Now I've added that I will serve up our people.

I'm a, you know, I mean, I'm a United States citizen. I'm standing here listening to this, what is my duty?\" I don't... must say-- I, I will still argue that I think the scenario that was spilled, uh, spin, spun out, that Dean spun out to Mitchell is basically the right one. It is essential that, uh, Roger's departure be delayed until this is over. Ya see, Rogers is gonna leave on the first of June, and, uh, but, uh, uh, he must We may be, we may be out of the woods by... May be... ...it might be over by then. He's articulate, he's, he's, uh, before television he's, uh, respected among, uh -he's one of the towering figures in the Ambassadorial world and in the bar. He has involved himself to the extent described above. But recognize, uh, What did Dean say to... ...but recognize... ...what did Dean say to... that kills him. Yeah basically he says that kills him. . Yeah. and he got off with plea bargaining for a misdemeanor. And he got an undetermined sentence that was suspended Friday. Didn't serve in jail and then, but, but, not only -you see, Bob He was indicted on a felony He did not -indicted on a felony... Pled to a -- Plea, plea-bargained to a misdemeanor, gets off with, uh, no sentence and so forth and, and Dash defends him and says that -and Lipschitz. ...that, that didn't disqualify him, he knew about it. You get them full pardons. way I would do it, Bob, you, you critique this, is I'd go up, and I'd say,... Alright. Under the circumstances, time is of the essence. But the, just as the def-, just as any, the defendants are entitled to that sort of Well now you're, you're glossing it. \"It, it's now time, I think, to rethink what best serves the President and also what best serves you to Right. in the ultimate outcome of this thing,\" Right. \"And we have to, have to, recognize that you are not going to escape indictment. And, uh, I'm here in behalf of the President --\" Well, and three, you have the dignified opportunity to discuss this in, in the, office of... EHRLICH14 Yeah. \"He has reviewed the facts now Right.

I have a couple of modifications to that. One, a minor ques-not to what you say, but in setting it up. The trouble with Rogers is that Mitchell will overrun him. Well, he'd roll his eyes and, and Rogers wouldn't know one way or the other. They would certainly be diverted. But the point is what, what they have that -they, their relations have Veen primarily with Dean. You've got a dentist appointment. “Uh, you're supposed to, you're in the executive branch, and a government official, you're supposed to tell me what, what all the chips are. ...pressured this poor boy over here.

The adversary type. ...although he may blow I can say, I can say that the the uh, uh, that I have, I have come to the conclusion that it is both John and Jeb who are liable Yeah.

I didn't know about the envelopes and the  and all that stuff. ...the point is that, that if Dean's, if the wrongdoing which justifies Dean's dismissal is his knowledge that that operation was going on... Yeah. It's a question of role, and I don't think Dean's role in the aftermath, at least from the facts that I know now, achieves a level of wrongdoing that requires that you terminate him. ...And he will become a focal point in the Ervin process.

I aimed him at Mitchell. ...dollars in cash... oh... ...What do you want to do with it... ...this was not requested by LaRue? He's got an IRS problem if he can't get it, get it--it's unaccounted. Eleven o'clock, that's when the armistice was signed, so off we go. We'll send an airplane for him. And by the time we get a plane mobilized and up there, it takes longer.

The President considers this of the highest urgency that you be aware of these developments. Something that just can't be postponed any longer. Harder than firing Hickel.

We had this meeting, and, and,\" uh, he, he lobbed, uh, mud balls at the White House at every opportunity -it was very interesting how he dragged it in, uh, yeah...  ...one after the other.

Which confirms he considers O'Brien to be his attorney? Exactly when Hunt made the challenge. I, in a sense, well said this to John because I wanted him to be impressed with the fact that, uh, uh, we were not jobbing him. Pardon me, er,er, Magruder intended to make a clean breast of it and that, that was first party information and very reliable, and that that would tend to begin to unravel this thing from the center -in both directions. That I was freezing him out of the operation? But there's no way he can prove it He has a very, very bad tremor. Well, I've never noticed Shakes. Do you think you should ask him that or do you not want to go digging. The point is that I want it to seem you want him to be, without guiding him or leading him, you can at least maybe get that out.

He says he's got a tape or a wire, uh; uh, a memo or something that says exactly what he said. That shows you-the somewhat incredible way unclear-state  of some of John Dean's analytical thinking. And that a, at the time, I was ready to report to you my tentative conclusions, and they were no more than that, you felt that they were sufficiently serious that, uh, well that, you felt that one overriding aspect of the report was that some people evidently were hanging back feeling that they were somehow doing the President a favor.

You had lawyers who were concerned about their fees, and that's less understandable. This says something that Dean was not, we could get him out of it, he, he could weasel out of the, I say weasel out, he says he's not involved in the perjury.

I don't understand him at all and Magruder paints him as really weird, really weird. Why,…  You may have forgotten the details. We had a runa-, we had a runaway antitrust division at that point.

That's right. ...on all this, and I said, now this is a violation of the rules  On policy, not on--  Basically that's the point, it's a violation of rules that I had laid down with McClaren.

When I say coach, I use the word loosely, and-     Well, no, a fellow over there named Porter, Bart Porter, for one. The whole thing is just monumentally tragic. According to Dean's story about those meetings, which he told me is about 180 degrees  Magruder's. And that Mitchell was the one who disapproved it. Mitchell phoned me this morning to say that Daniel Schorr had been on the shuttle when he rode back to New York. CBS caught him? I have no information on the subject. I have no information on the subject. I have no information on it. We are at kind of an ebb tide right now in this whole thing, in terms of the media, as I see it.

I go in and out of the damn hotel, they're yelling: Watergate, Watergate. And Haynes Johnson, of course, is notorious for finding what's he's looking for.

It's a curious thing, but that's, but I'm afraid that's the way it operates. I described the story to you in some detail when lie walked down 17th Street--   No. John tells me, too, uh and basically the culprit is Pat Gray. That's why Colson calling, Colson, Colson was caught because Colson was in the room when it was handed to Gray. Kehrli says the same thing. The other point is, the other element of this question how is Hunt, and as far as Dean is concerned, he's basically the one that surprises me and disappoints me to an extent, because he really is trying to save his neck and doing so easy. with Petersen, they've got an incentive to exaggerate.\n",

      " ...but it rests upon some decisions... That the message that he bad for you that he had to and wanted to explain at length is why Dean had to be dealt with summarily. ...knowledge imputed to us is knowledge imputed to you, and if Dean is  and testifies that he imputed great quantities of knowledge to Er-or passed great quantities of knowledge to us, and is allowed to get away with that... Yeah. ...that, that will seriously impair the Presidency ultimately. Uh, either suspension or firing of Dean in the course of an explanation, a historical explanation of your reliance on the Dean Report it's apparently unre, it's apparent unreliability. And I guess Rose agrees, it's gotta be Rose, or whatever..  My problem at the present time is I just don't want to have to talk to each of those, uh, these, uh, sideline people individually, 'cause I, I don't know. He said Ostrow had called. He supports the Garment plan. I think -Understand, I'm not ruling out kicking his ass out. Well, he's not in any position to bargain with you on that. Petersen is not charging you legally. charged Dean legally. Now, uh, based on that-- Well, that takes me to my next step, which is-my continuing misgivings about Petersen. Now, I just cannot mat by quietly. And, uh, I'll do it by fair means or foul. Oh, I'd love to avoid it. . I'd love to avoid it. that the dagger shouldn't have to be stuck. This is a politically sensitive-- That, “Here the, here's this material from Hunt's safe.” Did he say it was politically sensitive . I, I told you about a previous conversation where it was described to me in those terms. That's precisely what Dean's told me after the fact had sprung out. That's the problem, I think if I  unbearable. In other words, there's a difference between actors and novices. I want you to think very critically about the difference here between knowledge of the general transactions going on, on the one hand, Yeah. ...and being an affirmative actor on the other, because that's-the difference between Dean and me. Uh, the-- Stracban included? You know, named, uh, Haldeman and Ehrlichman... Yeah, but you see it's typical. Dean position now...  Now—if Dean is treated different from us, he will go out and say, \"I'm a scapegoat for higher, higher-ups.” That figures 'cause he knows Ostrow because Ostrow is the guy that covers Justice. I don't think they got much more in the White House, unless, I don't know what it could be unless they got Colson stuff that would be the only area. Well see, the thing that precipitated Colson's coming over is that... So, Colson called and says you've got an aspat your bosom over there. In other words, he basically put the shoe on the other... Shit. And I said, uh, uh, uh, and here's a guy that comes in and in effect confesses to you the commission of crimes. And I said, \"Now wait, these charges\" -I said, \"These charges are not uh --\", and you see he also has an alibi in the U.S. Attorney... Small wonders. At this point, the way we're in the soup now, we can lose nothing by going out That's right. Well, that's a hell of a bomb shell just right there. I don't think the Committee Hearings will ever go forward. I don't think there is any chance  of their not going forward. or, unless you got...

Yeah. ...and my date books...

Then Petersen, he said, \"We’ve got to have corroborative testimony.”  So you see what I mean? ...are: That basically Dean was the sole proprietor of this project; Um hum. Well, statistically, it's interesting. We'll have to push the button. And Moore frequently. Now that is the stuff, stuff that is clearly identifiable, according to Petersen, as being telephonic taps. The interesting thing is-- ...where's there's discrepancy... I gues, 'cause there was an Operation GEMSTONE that Strachan got reports on. I though SEDAN CHAIR too was the, was the Watergate. Then if GEMSTONE is-.the total thing, then, then... According to Strachan, right? Well, wha, what made him insecure. No, but, th, th, the point is that you, you had, you were resting secure on his assurances. Okay, then what moved him off of that belief and assurance? That phrase recurs. What was Dean's line here before he, uh, uh, uh, deserted? You see, my aim, my point, my point is you've got to watch out. ...specific terms to specific people. Amy misapprehension, so forth and so on, to ah, all parties involved, who were those people, that it could be against , but then I would not say  not say. Well, except remember I informed Kleindienst on Saturday. I informed him, informed ah, I informed Kleindienst over the weekend,.well the windup questions, is did he inform me personally. I passed the word, ah, I ah informed the ah Attorney General, ah why don't we say through John Ehrlichman, I mean, ah, at my direction John Ehrlichman, ah filled in the Attorney General completely on the information we had developed and ah, on Sunday, determining on that determining the Attorney General on so and so, ah, ah, they, they indicated that ah, as a result their invest--and as a result, that they resulted therein a major there, a, major developments in the case these major developments, ah, ah, ah involved charges of, uh, considering that all charges have been mentioned, major developments, in the case at that point. I've, ah, I've asked that ah  to any, any Governmemt people who have been, who I understand who have been, ah who are directly or indirectly ah, the subjects of the investigation even though, I mean ah, all this is no indication for your guilt, ah, will, ah, ah be relieved of their duties, ah and ah, until ah, ah until the President, ah, until the Grand Jury receives from them, say, obviously anyone who refuses to cooperate will be dismissed. Anyone who is indicted will be dismissed. Well, at any rate-- How about anyone granted immunity? Now, ah, ah Pete, Petersen, isn't it? I think maybe the point that Petersen's missing...ah, ah maybe intentionally so, is that Dean is a major actor in this thing. And the guy that grants it is reporting daily to you. And be says-he's gonna give me some song and dance. And they said if that had happened that would have been burned into my recollection as an extraordinary thing like you ordering... ...placement center, for example.

I'm telling you now that those charges are in the possession of the government. “This is a town that is so full of wild charges that if I operated on the other basis, even of those who were brought to me by 20 bishops and an Attorney General, I couldn't be suspending people around here or the place would look like a piece of swiss cheese.

He said, uh, he said, \"Frankly, somebody needs to be quite candid, that we are--ought not to include Haldeman and Ehrlichman on that list.” Which gives you an option. All we have to be sure of is giving Dean immunity, any token. I’m, I'm sure the sentence will fit the crime. Well, the guy who gains from that is Dean.

I'd say, \"Fellas, you've been charged, yeah, I know that Dean has made some charges.”  Right? Either one of us hangs together when we're playing games. Do you automatically suspend any witness who's called before a Grand Jury? Why don't we regroup at 5:30 and decide then. You have the first page intact? Did she use the speech typewriter?

When you have a, a case that’s serious and you have people who are on the periphery, and you want to name them, ah, in order to have them available as a witness, you name them as a co- conspirator without indicting them.

And so this is a list of people who in, in a description of a conspiracy pattern are co- conspirators. That’s, that' s worse than puttin' them on the list. What the Constitution provides is that before charges  a group of citizens can view the evidence. But, I think, in this case the gravity is such that that’s all baloney. That’s alright for somebody stealing automobile   from the sidewalk or something but, know, people in, in public positions  are entitled to the protection of the Grand Jury.

I guess, I just dread, frankly, the possibility of their feeding on itself to the point  where  reasonably all right with you is in, in one column. Remember, I--often told you that Eisenhower said  and basically you folks didn't do a God.damn thing. Anyway, you know that Edgar had very, very close ties with, with Marx people, you know they didn't want to investigate.the Ellsberg thing. And so certain rather routine investigatory efforts were conducted from here. This one, this one was apparently in excess. …or, or, in one stroke, or nibbling by nibbling, we ultimately are on a path of, of destruction in other words where they get to--just what you're saying. I think the President is going to be badly hurt by our stepping out. It was the principals that you were  served by. I can't act responsibly unless I know that... I think that remains to be seen. Richard Kleindienst was in Los Angeles when we get to San Clemente. I informed him that you had my letter and, it uh, appointed me to get into this. And, so, that ought to be added into the mix in terms of the whole sequence of events...     ...so that you were on top of it on the 31st of March. It depends on the circumstances and, and we don't know yet what the circumstances will be. Now, that may be born of a forlorn hope, but...  Yeah. We don't know what the circumstance of Dean's return blast will be if there is one. ...you...     ...you have to be totally comfortable with our staying...  No, I'm comfortable. Frankly, I, you know when I  decide an exploring the PR aspects  Sure,  ...I'm comfortable as hell. There is a, there is a, an intangible ingredient here. And to the extent that that pumps adrenalin in with my viability or my reputation or my ability to cope with the problem, it's obviously to my interest. And so, that's something that I would hope would be spent very sparingly. Uh, that's why I say I think we ought to wait and see what develops here. I, I, I, I, honestly can tell you that I spend my resources in a very deliberate way, and uh, and uh, you know, he might soften. Uh, if you take occasions to separate yourself from this, take occasions to condemn the wrongdoers in a way that not, not...  Not   ...faultily but uh, uh,  uh, if you communicate uh, uh, uh, your sentiments uh, in some way or other, as backgrounders or otherwise, uh, I think you can come through this rough water uh, very nicely, uh, the uh, the it's certainly uh, but you . I don't, I don't think it's, even remotely approaches being fatal. Right now you've got to consolidate your gain. Now if you can get out the chronology of how you got into this and r-, rooted it out. It's a powerful, there are power ful forces that weigh against his doing it, so it's a good possibility he won't. You know why it bought us that because they saw us on the sword with the blood running out. You are in a rotten frame of mind on this, uh you are . And you made the right moves as it turns out and are proximately responsible for the, for the uncovering of this thing. Now there may be individuals that we all regret   Right.\n",

I was trying to bury, I was trying, I was really trying to probe his thought processes. This may be some measure of hindsight, but I really don't think it is because my very conscious contemporary reaction when Dean came back and didn't have anything for us, was, whoops, there's something more here, because Dean could have constructed some kind of an artful ah, ah, evasion if he hadn't been so pervasively involved. Dean's got Shaffer and the rest. Just say, \"Look here, you are going to be liable, separately liable, for breach of confidentiality and, ah,  Is that a case? ...Well, I think you ought to get Petersen to advise you on this, but there certainly is, there certainly is a statutory protection, and I think you could invoke it. breach of confidentiality of a conversation with the President?

This was relayed from Mrs. Hunt to Bittman, to Parkinson, to Mitchell and LaRue, and they, the defendants were threatening to cause general havoc if they were not helped. O'Brien is unhappy with his role in this, too. LaRue or O'Brien said it was a crisis. Haldeman said to have Strachan get the money but to clear it as soon as possible. Haldeman said to get all the money out of here and get a receipt for it. Dean advised Haldeman and Ehrlichman of this threat. He referred to Christmas as the time when clemency actions were usually taken, and Hunt was satisfied with this.\" …and that Colson be extremely circumspect about what he said to Bittman and we discussed clemency and Colson's recollection and mine, both are that I was very categorical in saying you cannot in any way infer the possibility of clemency. That's the reason for stressing it, as I did. He said that, uh, Hunt's in a hell of a shape… Colson has every intention  it's to his overriding interest to do so. His wife was heavily insured.

We feel it's imperative that until, until the, they're cleared these charges in other words  cleared that you feel that, uh, you're, uh, you're, uh, continuing in your duties, uh, but that you, that your ability, the faculty to your carry on your duties will be seriously impaired. See-- set of circumstances. I regard, argue freely that you've get three different kinds of situations here. Generalized, it's a generalized kind of thing. RESTRICTED-“D”     Yeah. RESTRICTED-“D” I would say is more direct. He was publicly accused of lying… …and who has handled a lot of private transactions with Dean. RESTRICTED-“D” Well, now if, if the premise is that someone is going to be a problem to the functioning of the Presidency… Right. Or you can say there're shade and gradations on this thing but judicial process is underway. But in the press, the witness is a target. Well, I come down to treating Dean differently than Bob, Bob was different than me. Now maybe that's the lull me or to trap me or something, but… Well I'll have to examine Petersen on that. And then the minute that surfaces… We're, we're joined on that, yeah. …and then if that surfaces, that I oughta bail out of here. You wouldn't be terribly happy with it, but I would be terribly happy with it, but I would be in a kinda any port in the storm situation at that point. Everybody… Well, I got another thing…  Well, I think, well… disadvantage and none of the advantages of, of saying he is a gentlemen.

They keep -they're, they're, they're careful about fixing me. They, they say the closest to fixing we they get is, I must have known. You know, you controlled all of your campaigns. That's why Dean's saying that, the uh, Ehrlichman is uh, uh, that, that Hunt's gonna blow the whistle on him, is black mailing. So he's not gonna print it verbatim anymore he's gonna paraphrase. ...and he selects what he's gonna paraphrase to put out, you're gonna have... He says Segretti's scared, and I said is that why he pled the Fifth Amendment? Somebody, incidentally, in that connection is preparing to  somebody the counterattack that we're gonna make on their campaign tactics. Here, I see where they fired some poor guy that hired a college kid for the purposes of participating in counter demonstrations and I can't understand that either. Do they think, they think for one moment that the demonstrators, that get us all over the place, were all unpaid? That's why I said if you could -may I just say on the counterattacks  career,  tire to do much on that. I think the record that I was not here sitting on my ass to watch my purse like a you know pig in a poke. But, by God, you can  PRESIDENT : and that's gonna be a very important function for you.

In the meantime, it's up to us to rally to the cause here. No, no they say that if, if it's a imperative fact in this that the President must not participate but where, uh, Ehrlichman gives them a run-down on the energy...  status and Shultz gives them a rundown on the economics,  gives them a rundown on the . We can't overlook the fact that the Watergate factors's here, you know... We're not overlooking it. And we're not overlooking it, but we can't overlook the fact that all of us have far more important missions in the long track... That's right. Believe me, uh, every individual here is expend --, is expendable, uh, in the event that the Watergate thing is, uh, touches him, even, even innocently, you know or something like that. I don't know how long that'll take, but as soon as welfare through with that I, you know. It's just, you just I don't meant to be, uh, slow on that, but it's...

There's no way that that can be brought out because it--there's no way that, that the Presidential, there's no forum for going into Presidential, uh, guilt, except an impeachment. And they have got to impeach you first before the proceeding starts and they aren't going to impeach you. No, I, I slept a little on that and it's good for John to look at it that way. Well, I didn't know then... Where's the line drawn between a legitimate effort to provide legal fees and an illegitimate effort to buy off defendants. I know, I know-But he said, \"I understand --\" Did I say, \"I understand that Pappas is helping,\" or, he said, \"Pappas was helping?\" All he said is that, I'm helping uh, helping, uh, uh, uh, John's special projects,\" and I said, \"Well thank you very much. You need to know what John has, but, uh, that was, that, that Pappas thing was so, you know, just, just--your \"I know\" was almost lost in the thing, he, he was going on, you injected, I know” He he to be damn alert to have remembered that and put it down. And you gotta assume that maybe he was, but, but the odds are very much against it. I do not accept that as even a remote possibility. And I think if he did, that's one more discrediting thing on him. There, and so that is the President being engaged in. Dean told me when I called him on Sunday, I recol-, I recollected this. Remember the April 17th tape. He said, \"I was sending a signal and-it got through.\" And that, \"The people I was sending it to under stood.\" Meaning, you know, about, uh, he said, \"Hunt was gonna blow the whistle,\" -not that he was... ...’cause John insisted it go in there, do  you recall? He's gonna be most vindictive as a witness, with immunity, or most vindictive? Yeah, but the only reason for granting immunity, to any witness, is to nail a more important defendant. Immunity to the defendant is to make him a witness for the purpose of nailing a more, more important defendant in terms of someone who... Yeah. Okay, then it's not a cover-up, it's an inducement for lying. Inducement to get somebody. But, it did not indicate that they were telephone taps. No, they didn't and as I understand, Magruder's thing, he says they weren't identified either. Whereas the material that he had, he says was identifired as Stage Coach Two--or whatever. That's a, it's a kind of curious, maybe irrelevant discrepancy, but it's, it's kind of -the secretary Who says that she typed this stuff up on special paper that was identified as Gemstone. ...in a stack of a lot of other stuff and  that in that he may have--I-, in, in, he, he said he probably identified it as Attached Tab H or something is a, uh, is a, uh, co--, sample of the intelligence operation that they've got going. Or of the output of the intelligence operation they've got going or something like that. I don't, God damn it, until this day remember what hap--, I don't really remember, do you? He says there is the problem, for example, of the pay-offs   recount the payments and I'd say why is that. Got a little on Pappas but that's almost coincidental, isn't it? Or what did I say--or we ought to keep the cork in the bottle that much or some damn phrase like that. It was really not a question of, of setting something up or something like that-it was, it, it created awareness of a problem and a brainstorming on the problem and no condoning of the problem...  ...except for the fact that I said well... It was agressively doing recognition. Uh, uh, uh,--I said, \"What, what about the legality of payments? I mean that for fees and support. It was after the Viet Nam announcement, after the 23rd, after the Inauguration. We didn't have any have any motive and we did not launch Kalmbach. Our, our thing was passive, uh, non, non disapproval really Yeah. Because he didn't want to get into Stans' fund raising. For their attorneys' fees. Well, no he says for hu--, humanitarian purposes.

I don't think so, I think because he, he explained it to you in elementary terms that the  that this was the first time you covered it. Well, that was after Kleindienst had come over, You have Kleindiesnt in the afternoon, you had Ehrlichman and me come in that evening, then you had Dean come in. Highly accurate. He says, for one thing, he says, \"Our sources declared categorically that President Nixon had no advance knowledge of the Water break-in and bugging. -Liddy submitted regular reports to Magruder on the bugging under the code name Gemstone. At the request of our  story-of contacting Magruder, Liddy going out to see Kleindienst at Burning Tree. \"Henry,\" instructed Kleindienst, \"I want you to be sure that these people are treated as any other person would be treated who was arrested under the circumstances.”   Liddy returned to campaign headquarters and began stuffing his file into a shredder. Eight cardboard cartons were sneaked out of the White House and stored at the warehouse and later, returned to the White House, most of the documents selectively destroyed. White House Aide Charles Colson, according to one source exploded, 'Do we want to make the White House an accessory to a fugitive from justice?’” Yeah, that's Colson. This was vigorously opposed by Clark MacGregor, who succeeded Mitchell as campaign chairman.”  That's Colson also. \"A few Presidential advisors, including Ehrlichman and Colson, warned the President to tred water because the Watergate decisions must have been approved by Mitchell and Dean. By mid-March the President's faith in Dean began to waiver. Colson meanwhile took a lie detector test and proved his own inn--, innocence. Dean was furious, \"Now, we're all gonna have to have to take one,\" Dean groaned. On Friday, April 13th, Ehrlichman confronted Dean with the charges.\" Chuck's tryin' to tie himself into the... Yeah. And the documents were destroyed . Although Colson, according to Dean, said they were about Watergate. Would you, would you say, well it's a privileged conversation, the President was authorizing disclosure? I would say it's a privileged conversation and the President's authorized me to characterize it as I remember it. Uh, and that had led to some areas as, and he had cited examples of, of, uh, problems. And one of the examples he cited was, uh, this threat. And then he probed different things. Well, he frequently calls me into meetings. Dean said, \"Well LaRue handles it, that he left it around at, at uh, uh, telephone booths.\" just knew that Pappas was  and helping with the campaigning. Well, but Pappas was, said he was helping on, uh... Yeah, he is but, I, I really... . ...wish he'd quit tryin' to help. 'Cause it nails Dean, kills Colson, and to a degree kills Ehrlichman. That Ehrlichman, uh... Well, he didn't really confront Dean with charges. And Dean had authorized payments to the defense to keep their mouths shut . After November 28th, 'cause he didn't have it ‘til... Why didn't he have it before November 28th? It was sitting over in the safe deposit box.

      " And Butterfield says that there was one withdrawal in May, he said, 22 thousand. And there was no other withdrawal until the total thing was taken out on November 28th. He's the one that supplies that date. Butterfield's memory would be God-damn clear. Butterfield's a brilliant, precise, . mortgage his house? Strachan counted out 40,000 when he delivered 40,000 because he was told by Dean to deliver him 40,000. Oh, it wasn't delivered on November 28th? It was delivered to Strachan on November 28th by Alex. But if Strachan didn't have it... Strachan didn't get it until November 28th, so it can't have been continually, it can't have been used before the election. If this is money for fees even after the election, after they had been convicted is that right, or pled or, what the hell was that . I think it was in January -it was before they were convicted. about his stating that  one of the lawyers . He hasn't pleaded guilty. That's something incidental, but it's still a mystery to me. Because... Well, that's what, quite a dif--, conversation differs, because it is foul. The charge that he had burglarized the Ellsberg. We've just explored segments and we get to the thing somewhere. And then afterwards, afterwards Ehrlichman said \"We will not, there's no dice .\" Ehrlich--, Ehrlichman, Ehrlichman to me, what I heard on that from Ehrlichman's viewpoint was screw him. Which surprised me, to be perfectly frank, because I though Ehrlichman would be concerned about it and he wasn't. He really cold cocked it to the extent that it surprised me very much and he checked with REEL 2 BEGINS Krogh who -see this refreshed me now. What the hell longer 'cause... ...what the hell... ... this guy disentangled it himself. And the thing that startled you is, and, and it did, clearly, was he said, \"Some people may go to jail.”  You said, \"Who?”  And he said, \"Well me to begin with.\" That, that he was really carrying the load. All I wanta know is procedure, you know. ...completely beyond belief. And he said, uh, and he, and he, he said to John, he said, uh, \"the Greek,\" which  Pappas. In other words, I had faith in the prosecuting team. Sure, you could say why didn't I appoint a commission? That was as of the, uh, fourt--15th of Mar--of April. You were just, you were considering various alternatives. I considered the special prosecutor. I considered the Presidential commission. That shows that we're investi--that this Administration's not covering up any longer. I was frankly relying on Ehrlichman, too. He didn't want Mitchell indicted. He didn't want this whole thing, you know, the, splattered all ov ' er, and then he finally came in to see me. You know why people kept the secrets from you? I could hire one and the President heed his advice.\" February 27th. My recollection is totally blank. I think that's what popped Dean loose. I stayed here to go to that Rogers' dinner for, uh Yeah. He said we don't react to a prisoner's statement. and he says, \"I see signs of the domino theory here. Hunt had dealings with the Cubans”. Dean, he says,\"Hunt had dealings with the Cubans. I sought to ignore it. I was vague on the specifics because of it. They were threatening to cause general havoc if they weren't helped.\n",

      "  Passed it on--he's not referring that to me. Ehrlichman called and authorized that. nean advised Haldeman and Ehrlichman of this threat. Colson told Bittman he could make no committment, but as a friend, he would assist,  the actual statement. O'Brien's very distressed with Mitchell. It was an accomplished fact that the center  and then there was a hiatus. But I've got all ~those dates where he totally says the opposite. I think Mitchell and Magruder have their ass in a sling, they're mixing apples and oranges for their own protection. He's trying to scare Dean and he. He sees this point of mixing apples and oranges. O'Brien and Parkinson are getting shaky themselves. He's trying to pick it apart. The FBI's falsely charged. So, I've created a super panel, in cooperation of all investigative agencies. The panel can remove a Federal employee, levy fines, and post criminal sanctions  also submit, if they want to. The President maintains the ultimate stroke which is a  until ‘75--'til '77. He suggests a panel of Earl Warren, Tom Clark, a former governor of some kind of . You see it evolved bit by bit. \"Mitchell told Dean to stiffen up. Dean thinks that Mitchell is saying that Dean should do everything Mitchell's way. We should beat Magruder to the punch on immunity by immunizing Dean. Dean thinks that Sirica oughta be  scare everyone. And LaRue said that, as a student of Mitchell, he feels John's on the verge of breaking. A narrow waiver that restricts me might work.  \" Maybe I could hire one, as the President's consultant. The best one I know is Hugh Schwartz, he's a Democrat . The only other one I know is Charlie Schaffer in Rockville\"--and now that's one of his lawyers. We should consider the solution of Dean not testifying. And you said it's important, one, that the President be isolated from all these discussions. And second, there must be no falling out on charges -like Ehrlichman -all different directions. Attorneys, Silbert and Glanzer, and they just sat and listened to take their temperatures as representatives of Dean regarding what would happen. His lawyers say he may have to on the technicals. Attorneys say they won't pursue the technical violations. Dean's lawyers think there will be practical immunity regarding the after-the-fact technical violations. I don't see how you can manage to carry all the load. He's just been here a few minutes, and he told me, and I think that's very important. - April 15th, uh --Yeah.--Right.--Right, I said right--Yeah.--Yeah. I think also Mitchell might have said it in a joke. Uh, don't you feel that under the circumstance, that uh, Gray, uh, I don't know, I think I'm overreacting, but uh, especially under these circumstances, don't you think he ought to resign? Do you want to think about it? He said held chat with you, uh, uh. Do you want to think about it overnight or should you react right away or what? Cause he obviously figures, well he counted on. -Yeah, that, that Dean told, he said that these were documents that were wholly unrelated to the, the, to the Watergate, and that they sould be destroyed. You were investigating him, he may have forgotten but, uh -I see. -And then the next day he said he refreshed, he refreshed his recollection and said, \"Yes, I did get the documents, and I was told to destroy them.”  That's what Pat Gray now says, is that correct? -Incidentally, may I ask, without reviewing the contents, did, uh, did you get to the bottom of the Sheppard mystery? But I know that, uh, he's got convictions and maybe we shouldn't act like, uh ... I think that under the circumstances that the destruction done or, even though it was done with no legal intent, uh, this ah, this uh, stupidity of the, it's unbelievable . So  for a full moon. He'll get, he comes to you, but, but don't be concerned about what he told, I mean, uh, what he holds, uh, trump card or blackjack and so forth. -Right.--Are Magruder's and Dean's stories variable ? How I can still sit here with, uh, I mean, I mean I'm restless with Ehrlichman and Haldeman's problem, naturally, if we, if you, but then I also have to wrestle with Dean's problem, because I'm aware of information that you are.\n",

      " You showed me here and well, he says, there goes my, uh, career. Well, I, I, I saw the expression. Then, finally, he said he refreshed his continued memory. He said, yes, held received them, but he destroyed them. and Ehrlichman was utterly shocked. And I'm sure Dean was utterly shocked. It doesn't say ordered him. It doesn't say told, it says He destroyed them . Uh, Truitt, uh, his comments, uh, it was after he had referred--he also had referred to the fact that the material was forged documents blaming uh, Kennedy for the assassination of . I thought it was Diem. And that they involved the assassination of Diem? He said that th-, among them was--he said there was a bunch of very bad political stuff and among them was some phony document, uh, that, that, uh--saying that Kennedy has instituted the assassination of Diem. Well, I would think this--it would be important first, for, uh--you have not reacted yet. I have not been checking with Dean about how he responds. That was Frank Strickler's reaction, too. Who is Frank Strickler? He denied it twice. And then finally refreshed his recollection and said, \"Yes, I got it.\" Then it's then Petersen tended to appreciate that. Appreciated, you mean, uh, uh, did it offend Gray? The guy is a frigging idiot. You can put Ambrose in there as Acting. If Ambrose, if he won't do it for a couple of months, why, uh, you know, he's clean and, uh,  political coloration. Regarding that because of qualifications well, anyway, back when he had campaigned a lot, not a lot, yeah For us? So he has a political coloration . Ruckelshaus, just for a couple of months? Then I'll -Bob changes it somehow. Mr. Dean had previously sealed it in a large envelope. Mr. Ehrlichman was present but neither then nor at any other time did he give Mr. Gray any request, suggestion, or instruction regarding what should be done with the contents. Mr. Ehrlichman does not know the nature of the contents. Mr. Ehrlichman discovered certain new facts concerning the contents of the Hunt safe on April 15, 1973. Or the, uh, the current, uh, position of the contents or something. Condition -the status -we already got that. The status of the contents. Oh, the disposition is the--what I'm driving at. Gerry Warren just puts it out Yeah. I would hope and pray that they were . They're... . . Who basically, as I say, were mortal enemies  Dean and Magruder are. If then- continued On the plea, wouldn't you . expect contributions. I'm sure we can because it shatters the FBI . Even if he was ordered to destroy it and did, uh--it shatters him. You don't think that's his trump card? What the hell do you think his trump card ? The encouraging part about it is the latter part that you wrote me today. And if you go--if you go into something that has to be purged, I would say yes-this is, this is the worst, uh, trump card he's got. I don't think it pulls his scheme off. . Because I don't think they could do that. That's when the, uh, that particular point in time, that's exactly what the President--the President at that time did not see that. You can't worry about nuances  because then  uh, uh . You have the insight  difficulty. Moore should be instructed not to say that you told him to do it.

He said, \"Do not try to get John Dean's concurrence or cooperation.”  He said . I'll dictate my statement.\" The New York Times will compose it. If the television reporter got . That office has a deadline. I think you'd have to, particularly with Cole,  Ehrlichman, in that job. The New York Times says it has it all solved .

We talked to him on the 21st, 2nd, 3rd . We do have a higher standard. We don't just say, \"Well, listen, I, I'm ice skating on a thin edge.\" I have allegations that are not true.

Of course, Henry won't, Henry won't grind an axe. See, bring Rush over basically is an indication of a permanent replacement rather than . Hard on people on a temporary assignment. There's another guy you could bring in temporarily would be accepted and could do it, would be controversial, but it might not be a bad move and you could do it on a temporary basis. But he, but he, then, then did not--you say, did not say that he was ordered to destroy them. Wonderful, loyal fellow and sometimes just rigidly  but, but, but let me say one thing, he's interested in the President's . But I must spy that the solution would be to testify, that I was ordered to destroy these documents or, and even that I gathered the impression that Mr. Dean wanted me to destroy them, that's practically the same thing, huh? I frankly think myself I'm not, I'm not of the view, just based on the newspaper stories, I'll reconsider. Thank God  has just not been available. 27th, 27th, 27th of February.

My point is, this situation is so temporary, you know what I mean, he's either gonna be uh, uh, defendant or  fooling around with the defendants . Uh, one thing he did say was this, he was amazed when I said that, that  together and he said probably you got the impression . He was in the 27th and the 28th, you saw him the 1st, then he wasn't in the 2nd, he wasn't in the 3rd, he was1t in the 4th, he wasn't in the 5th, he was in for ten minutes on the 6th, 25 minutes on the 17th, again not very much there in early March. Not at all on the 8th, not at all on the 9th, not at all on the 10th, not at all on the llth, not at all on the 12th, not at all on the 13th, then he started on the 14th. That's when he really started, March 14th, and that was when you had Dean and Moore, then he started that cycle. You met with them on the 14th, you met with them on the 15th, you met with Dean alone on the 16th. I think he's gonna strike at us, he keeps lobbing these things out . I think he's got a whole bag of goodies probably . Goodbye,   us over for dinner. Go ahead, I'll have a coke or something. This is purely the, uh, political  is a little kid's style . Connally backed off, Rogers backed off. But it's also the highest risk.\" Well, isn't that identical to what I just-- they're now saying, firing Haldeman just won't do any good. That we-- To block, uh, to, uh, to resign, too. ...I think you're to the, yeah, I think you're you you got to say, you've got to say something to the extent that this is a lousy, cruddy mess and, and . Yeah, I might, if it seems fitting, I might say it to the Chamber of Commerce  that, I mean I can't go up there  about Watergate. I just, I, I, I know you-- Republican resolution demanding Haldeman's resignation. But you see, I'd like to beat  to the punch. ...Rockefeller  George Bush  Vice President. And we kept one jump ahead of the  RESTRICTED-“D” sheriff. Well, just, just think you did something, there are, there are a lot of them that would be delighted to see... Like they were with Sherman Adams. ...really who want to see John bombed and Dean put both of us... Yeah, yeah, yeah. They hated Adams. Fairness is a factor in it. I told people that they lose ball games. But in the introduction basically on the old pro-proposition of crises book then I -I . That's the normal factor. Unless it impairs the operation of the President. Now we get to the point  postpone where in the beginning where it does impair. It maybe, shouldn't be a live audience. So, it's gotta override the press. We gotta go through all that, uh, the higher standards. The most important thing is to preserve what we have. And ah, ah, now ah, I have no other responsibilities to the founders of my country, except to be President, and I'm going to certainly devote  of this country . Violent, violent take-over  so forth and so on, but you see, beside this and the other, they want an  speech. There were 15 incidents of that . Ah, not a justification, but I got an excuse. But do you think the people of the United, ah, the United States are gonna impeach the President on the basis of John Dean? I mean, John Dean's zingers just burn  Dean's been totally discredited by it right now. I think the way we can do it, since you can't treat us differently, okay.\n",

Brandon's been zapped for years. that as soon as that's finished RESTRICTED-“D”   I sent Rick down, and he's working on it attentively. And we're thinking the \"Filler\" game-plan will look-- Good. There were newsmen and, and government officials. We could just say, \"Newsmen were included.\" I've got the figures, gentlemen, and here they are. And newsmen were tapped. And that will enable Gerry to stand up on Wednesday and clobber McCloskey and -'cause he's been getting scoops on wiretaps. He said Stans is a victim of circumstance. And then the question of all the lawsuits . I said, \"Well, all those suits should be settled. Kennedy's men were on the floor during the debate, uh. Then I said, \"Johnson believed Bobby bugged him.\" A brain tumor. And, uh, uh, the grapevine of the Bureau is that, uh, they did it. it's in a memorandum, where the Agnew plane out of Chicago had been bugged. He said that the, that uh, uh, that they were using probation officers . We talked about a black, Mar-he pointed out that Marshall was in bad health. I said, \"Well, I didn't, I didn't know whether that was confirmed or not.”  And I said, \"In my view,\" I said, of there's a, there's a good fellow, uh, a black, who's that fellow, Brown, who's the head of the Equal Economic Opportunity,\" but I said, \"maybe Jewels Lafontaine is the best.”  I said, \"There you kill two birds with one stone. I said, \"How would you like Teddy Kennedy to propose the judges?”   I said, \"I want you to know that appointments are not going to go on the basis of -they, they're saying that you need a Jewish seat.\" And I said, \"Now look, there's no Jewish seat on that Court.\" I said, \"There are Jews all around this White House.”  I said, \"You've got Arthur Burns; you've got Henry Kissinger; you've got .” And I said, \"What we have to do, we’ve got to ri- realize we've got to appoint some .

And then Dean says, \"The dangers in the hang-out-- there are dangers in the hangout,\" and he said, \"I think I can convince Ehrlichman that there's dangers in it for him.\" or awareness of payments to people.

But getting down, listening to this thing, the one through the seventeenth, it totally explodes Dean's proposition or whatever. Uh, Buzhardt said that Dean made a friendly gesture to him Saturday. No, I didn't hear about the friendly gesture. By the way, I found that I just can't-- not able to reproduce them, so I, I'm writing them down by numbers  it's faster.
